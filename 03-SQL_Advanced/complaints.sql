This federal agency has levied millions in penalties against several medical collection agencies for abusive collection practices since the 2015 mandate that consumers must be granted 180 days-notice that any or all medical debts can not be posted against a consumers credit report. What this entails is that I as an American consumer needs time to either settle a medical collection before said collection gets posted on my credit report, or that my medical insurance carrier had enough time to resolve the collection either in full or by any sustained factoring agreement in place with the medical servicer, be it a physician, clinic, ambulance service or hospital. That has not been the case in the attached medical collection ( s ) posted on XXXX, XXXX and XXXX XXXX respectfully. Since the 2015 agreement between the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and all three credit reporting agencies, medical collection agencies have violated this agreement in its entirety. Having established that there is a specified procedure in place on medical collection postings on a consumers credit, it is a fact that most if not all medical collectors are in violation of their subscriber agreement with the major credit reporting agencies. Since my rights have already been violated by the collection agency stated in this complaint, the collection should be VOID completely. I am not disputing any factual conclusion if I was even given medical attention, just stating that my personal credit history has been damaged by an unlawful collection practice. I should be entitled to damages for the overall cost involved with what would otherwise be a perfect credit history. Accordingly, I respectfully request for the disputed medical collection ( s ) to be deleted permanently, and if this particular collection agencies needs a remedy for collection, it has abused the credit reporting system by violating my rights. In my opinion the only recourse at this time would be moving forward through other collection processes outside of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The disputed collection must be deleted permanently, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau must sanction and fine the agency for its abusive actions. The credit reporting agencies should also terminate the subscriber agreement if place. My dispute is based on material facts and current policies on medical collections. The attached disputed collection ( s ) should be deleted permanently without any right to reinsert from this point forward.');

Unfortunately they did bill me for up keep of their own system in charges that were more than {$500.00} in up keep they would not put batteries in their system to update nor would they update smoke detectors under a contract making the customer pay more than {$500.00} just for the smoke the detectors and glass breaker up keep. The customer is not advised after the tech leaves of the bill and is never aware of what is owe. The customer does not get an on site bill and later is in shock on money owed. When a customer calls they do not get accurate billing and it is a considerable long time in wait to get a hold of someone to handle account. I paid my bill they advised that I owed the amount of {$310.00} this amount was paid. Today I get a bill from a collection company for the same amount of {$310.00} that they deducted from my checking account. They are not advising the customer what they are doing not sending notices and billing the customers for services without the customers consent. The company is making money from the consumer by not upgrading their system and making the customer pay to do so. The company is not straight forward with the consumer about charges owed and the consumer is blinded not knowing money owed. The company renews contracts without signatures.');

They have done this in access of over 6 months. Additionally, due to this false and erroneous information, they have caused my line of credit to decrease from other creditors where my payment history is flawless. SB also have tacked on a ridiculous, and I am sure unlawful, interest amount. When I purchased furniture from XXXX XXXX for my new home, I took out a line of credit which was only {$1000.00}. I paid cash at the same time. I have been paying on this line of credit since 2017 and the total balance they are now trying to collect from me is {$1800.00}. Also, they are sending threatening letters to me and saying they have tried to contact me. I have received NO calls from this creditor. Second, SB reported to the bureaus I was late and thereafter sent me notification 2 months the later- after they ruined my credit and they continue to do so each month. At this point, because they have violated FCRA rules I am NOT submitting any payments to them. Each month they report 2 late payments. For example, on my XXXX  report it shows, non payment for XX/XX/XXXX and then they reported it again on XX/XX/XXXX. SB did this for about 3 months before I was even aware they were reporting this false information. They have been reporting this information like I said earlier without my knowledge or communicating to me first.');

The hospital got all the information they asked for including my SSN, address and phone ( I handed them my drivers license ). 

A few weeks later i received a letter from my insurance company that a portion was paid by the insurance, the letter said that I still need to pay to the hospital {$1700.00}. No problem till here since I was expecting to get a bill from the hospital. 

But, a few weeks later I received a call from a company called XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ). This company obviously had my phone number and my address ( The information about my address is important in what will come next ). The 1st call, they mentioned the street address where I live asking me for the complete address since this is personal, as they claim, I refused and asked them to send what they want in writing. 

They called a 2nd time and a third and I kept telling to send me a mail but I didnt get a mail from them. Last time I received a call from a lady, telling me shes from XXXX ( she has a notable accent, close to a british ), she was pressing me to tell her my address since she kept mentioning the street address. I finally did, she said shes a  debt collector, that I was in a hospital and that I have to pay {$1700.00}, she tried to make me pay right on the phone call by asking for a credit card and making pay about {$700.00} less ( XXXX ), I said I will pay this on the evening when I come back from work. I did speak to her about my address asking why I am not getting a mail, and I found out that the last digit of my address was XXXX  instead of XXXX  ( Note there is big difference in the shape of XXXX  and XXXX to say that someone had confused those 2 numbers when taking my address ) .I closed the phone. 

Then I called the hospital ( XXXX XXXX ). They asked for my last name and address to verify me, then I askes them if I there is a bill for me in their system. They said yes and the amount is XXXX. I told them about the call I got from XXXX asking to collect this amount. They replied that they never heard about this company and that my bill was never sent for collection and is still far from that. Then I asked them why I never received a bill from the hospital, they said they sent it to my address. I asked them about the address they have, and to my surprise the last digit of thsi address was XXXX instead of XXXX, same as XXXX, I asked the hospital to modify the address to the right me one and to send me the bill. 

After a few days I completely paid that hospital and I also received the bill. 

Now, this company XXXX is keep calling me, and they change the number they call from but I am ignoring them. Today I received a letter from them ( finally XXXX telling me Your promissed payment of XXXX is due, that is it. 

This company XXXX is obviously a scammer, they somehow were able to get my contact information from the hospital ( Since both had the same, but wrong address ), without the hospital authorization ( this was confirmed by the hospital ). Those people should be put in prison since they are unlawfuly trying tomsteal money from other, using phone calls and pressing people to pay right on the line. I am writing this to help other people to deal with such situation and hoping that someone from the goverment is able to punish people operating this scammmat XXXX. 

The letter I finally received from XXXX contain their address ( where the payment should go to ) so I hope they can be tracked and punished');

Weeks later, after not validating the debt to me at all, the company opened up collections derogatory mark on all three of my credit reports. This is something they''ve been asked by courts to not do in the past by the way. When I contacted the company to cease and desist, they were very difficult to work with and kept asking me for PII, they were rude, once again provided no information to validate the debt, or any information about their business. When I asked them for the information regarding their registered legal agent, they simply declined to provide it.

Works and Lentz sent out a notice that I owe a debt in the amount of {$190.00} but the notice was sent out after they added the account to my credit report, in violation of the FDCPA 809. Validation of debts ( a ) Notice of debt ; contents Within five days after the initial communication with a consumer in connection with the collection of any debt, a debt collector shall, unless the following information is contained in the initial communication or the consumer has paid the debt, send the consumer a written notice containing -- ( 1 ) the amount of the debt ; ( 2 ) the name of the creditor to whom the debt is owed ; ( 3 ) a statement that unless the consumer, within thirty days after receipt of the notice, disputes the validity of the debt, or any portion thereof, the debt will be assumed to be valid by the debt collector ; ( 4 ) a statement that if the consumer notifies the debt collector in writing within the thirty-day period that the debt, or any portion thereof, is disputed, the debt collector will obtain verification of the debt or a copy of a judgment against the consumer and a copy of such verification or judgment will be mailed to the consumer by the debt collector ; and ( 5 ) a statement that, upon the consumer ''s written request within the thirty-day period, the debt collector will provide the consumer with the name and address of the original creditor, if different from the current creditor. 
( b ) Disputed debts If the consumer notifies the debt collector in writing within the thirty-day period described in subsection ( a ) of this section that the debt, or any portion thereof, is disputed, or that the consumer requests the name and address of the original creditor, the debt collector shall cease collection of the debt, or any disputed portion thereof, until the debt collector obtains verification of the debt or a copy of a judgment, or the name and address of the original creditor, and a copy of such verification or judgment, or name and address of the original creditor, is mailed to the consumer by the debt collector. Collection activities and communications that do not otherwise violate this subchapter may continue during the 30-day period referred to in subsection ( a ) unless the consumer has notified the debt collector in writing that the debt, or any portion of the debt, is disputed or that the consumer requests the name and address of the original creditor. Any collection activities and communication during the 30-day period may not overshadow or be inconsistent with the disclosure of the consumers right to dispute the debt or request the name and address of the original creditor. 
A dispute letter was sent to Works and Lenzt, they had thirty days to respond and aloud an additional 15 days, to validate as required by FDCPA. they responded in the 30 days that they could not validate the account, that they were waiting on there client, this is were the law allows them the additional 15 days. more then 30 days after that Works and Lenzts then send papers stating they have validate the account but the letter is not sent by the collection but by attorney in violation of FDCPA 812. Furnishing certain deceptive forms ( a ) It is unlawful to design, compile, and furnish any form knowing that such form would be used to create the false belief in a consumer that a person other than the creditor of such consumer is participating in the collection of or in an attempt to collect a debt such consumer allegedly owes such creditor, when in fact such person is not so participating.

( b ) Any person who violates this section shall be liable to the same extent and in the same manner as a debt collector is liable under section 1692k of this title for failure to comply with a provision of this subchapter. 

Now works and Lenzts has added another collection account to XXXX  for the amount of {$390.00} but has not sent collection letter before adding to credit report in Violation OF FDCPA 809. Validation of debts I would say Works and Lenzt can file a small claims case, oh wait that would violate Oklahoma law stated below. 
XXXX Oklahoma Statutes Title 12. Civil Procedure 12-1751. Suits authorized under small claims procedure. 
Universal Citation : 12 OK Stat 12-1751 ( 2016 ) A. The following suits may be brought under the small claims procedure : 1. Actions for the recovery of money based on contract or tort, including subrogation claims, but excluding libel or slander, in which the amount sought to be recovered, exclusive of attorney fees and other court costs, does not exceed XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Dollars ( {$7500.00} ) ; 2.  Actions to replevy personal property the value of which does not exceed XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Dollars ( {$7500.00} ). If the claims for possession of personal property and to recover money are pled in the alternative, the joinder of claims is permissible if neither the value of the property nor the total amount of money sought to be recovered, exclusive of attorney fees and other costs, exceeds XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( {$7500.00} ) ; and 3. Actions in the nature of interpleader, as provided for in Section 2022 of this title, in which the value of the money which is the subject of such action does not exceed XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Dollars ( {$7500.00} ). 
B. No action may be brought under the small claims procedure by any collection agency, collection agent, or assignee of a claim, except that an action may be brought against an insurer or third-party administrator by a health care provider as that term is defined in Section 6552 of Title 36 of the Oklahoma Statutes, who is an assignee of benefits available under an accident and health insurance policy, trust, plan, or contract.');

I was offered no opportunity to even dispute this alleged debt from the unknown creditor. This is the first and only communication that I have ever rcvd from this office. Additionally, the signature is a photo copy of " XXXX XXXX '''' ''s signature. The letter also states a current balance of {$340.00}. However, the offer is for " 25 % off of the current balance due and owing ''''. How much are they demanding? They also state that the payment must be made in a " lump sum ''''. If this is a valid debt, from a valid creditor, they can NOT demand payment in full. Also they have failed to provide their consumer debt collection license. 
This Law firm has clearly violated the numerous laws within the FDCPA and furthermore my consumer rights. 
I am asking for immediate sanctions to be brought against this firm, and they should be thoroughly investigated.');

I tried to work out the bill but they sent me immediately to the collection office of http : //vincebuzeklaw.com/ I believe this attorney office/debt collection office has worked with this sprinkler contractor before to try to collect his fraudulent bills. I think this attorney office should be investigated for trying to collect on fraudulent bills by the sprinkler company they represent, XXXX   based in XXXX, co. 

I will describe what happened with the sprinkler guy below, but first I want to describe what happened with the collection attorney office. They sent me the first collection letter. Then I sent them a dispute letter. Then they sent me a letter that did not verify the debt at all but just stated " she needs to pay the invoice '''' from their sprinkler client. They can not verify the debt because it is fraudulent. This collection attorney office needs to be investigated for doing this to people and ruining people ''s credit reports. Before this happened I had never not paid a bill in my life and I had over 800 credit rating for over 30 years. This collection attorney and his fraudulent client need to be stopped from hurting people. I will attach all correspondence. 

This is what happened with the sprinkler contractor before they sent me to this collection attorney office. 


1. XXXX XXXX quoted me {$80.00} per hour for work. He was at my house for 2 hours without successfully turning on sprinkler system. He just walked around and tried to get me to agree to big amounts of work. I fired him and hired a sprinkler professional who turned on my sprinkler system within an hour and charged me {$260.00}. 2. XXXX arrived and turned the valve to turn on water but then just walked around citing problems he did not fix. He was very hostile the whole time he worked. When I fired him the sprinkler system was not in working order at all. He improved nothing. He gave rude, angry short responses to my questions and was not helpful. 3. He replaced two heads in front of me that are the tall sprinklers for landscape ( not on lawn ), I now would not let him do this as it was not needed 4. He asked me if I wanted to replace all my sprinkler heads with MP rotors and I TOLD HIM NO, then he charged for 17 MP Rotors replacement time and material. This work was not approved or completed, I do not have MP rotor heads in my lawn! 5. I fired XXXX after he had put 2 hours into NOT turning on my sprinkler system. I offered to pay him on the spot for the hours he had been there, but he said I would get billed in a few months. He obviously planned to fraudulently bill me and threaten collections, which is his mode of operation. 6. He told me flat out that he did not want to fix the leaking valve which he brought a diaphragm over to fix which did not fix anything. I should not have to pay for his time or the diaphragm due to his incompetence in trying to fix the valve that he did not know how to do. 7. He wanted to dig up my patio because he saw water near the rocks. The sprinkler company I hired after I fired XXXX said there would have been no need to dig up the patio at all ever. 8. I wrote down the time and dates he was at my house and it came to 2 hours. His charge for 8 hours of labor is false. 9. He sent me a bill 2 months after he was at my house ( he was there in early XX/XX/XXXX and the bill came in XX/XX/XXXX ) for {$890.00} which is extortion. 

I have 2 separate letters I wrote to them to get them to address my concerns that they over-charged me but he had his bookkeeper sent me the same bill over and over and threatened me with collections immediately. It is clear they do this regularly and have the collection attorney I am complaining about on immediate retainer. 
I have offered to pay him for the actual time and material he spent at my house. He bills {$80.00} an hour. I took the items off the bill that I know he did not do and I reduced the hours from 8 to 2 1/2. My offer to pay him was more than he should have been paid. He had his bookkeeper send me the same bill again. I am over XXXX years old and II should be protected by law from this abuse.');

Their system will NOT allow an online payment less than the usual automatic auto-payment amount ( I''ve dealt with them on this before! ) and to be very clear on what payments were made, I waited until my auto-payment was deducted on XX/XX/19. 

Then, I made an online payment of the balance of the pay-off amount in my pay-off letter on XX/XX/19. The payoff amount is good until XX/XX/19. 

I am very excited and anxious to get the release of my mortgage so thank goodness I am watching this carefully. Yesterday, I get an email with my new monthly statement. It reflects my XX/XX/19 auto-payment and shows the final payoff amount I paid as an " unapplied amount. '''' The " more information '''' under that says that they will hold these funds until the next payment due date, which for my account is XX/XX/19. Past my pay-off date, which would mean there would be additional nominal fees needing to be paid. 

This is completely unacceptable! 
When I made the online payment, I indicated that it should be made on XX/XX/19 - if they aren''t going to apply funds when indicated by the customer, rather just apply them per the usual schedule, they need to make that clear. Actually, they shouldn''t be allowed to hold customer ''s payments past the date the customer indicated - they are earning interest for those days held, ill-gotten and illegal gains, in my book. 

I have hated every dealing with this company for the last few years since they bought my mortgage. They have incredibly XXXX and misleading practices for customers that I think are appalling. 

Please investigate them and DO SOMETHING!');

In XX/XX/XXXX, I filed for ChapterXXXX bankruptcy and this amount should have been included. Not to mention, after filing for Chapter XXXX  bankruptcy again in XX/XX/XXXX, this amount should again have been removed from my records at the PenFed Credit Union. It is evident this charge-off that has stayed on my credit has  undoubtedly had a severe impact on the type of credit I receive and the interest rate charged for the past 21 years.

I kept this account open despite of the charge-off. Each time I go into the bank to withdraw my own funds, the tellers have to obtain an override - this is embarrassing. To add insult to injury, I am a XXXX  employee - I am limited with funds to pay debtors. I was unable to open a checking account, obtain a debit card, and the like due to this charge-off.

The PenFed Credit Union is offering assistance for members who have been with the credit union for at least 12 months. I was told by PenFed that I could obtain Direct Deposit Assistance. Meaning, if I was an existing member with PenFed and have an existing direct deposit into a PenFed deposit account, I could qualify for their Direct Deposit Assistance program. This program allows me during the government shutdown to take advantage of a 0 % advance on an overdraft line of credit in the amount of your most recent direct deposit from a qualifying government agency, up to {$6000.00}. For qualifying members with an existing overdraft line of credit will be increased by the amount of the direct deposit to accommodate the advance. For members without an overdraft line of credit such as myself, who otherwise qualify, an overdraft line of credit would be opened for me to accommodate the advance, and NO CREDIT CHECK is required for qualifying members.

I was told I didn''t qualify because of the charge-off still on the account from XX/XX/XXXX. The representative on the line indicated that even though I filed for bankruptcy, they still have the right to keep the charge-off on the account until they are able to collect the {$7100.00}. This is clearly a violation of bankruptcy laws and discrimination.

I was told to contact a XXXX XXXX at the Credit Union, which I believe is a bogus name.

This is false advertisement and acts of insensitivity during my times of hardship. I have {$1000.00} going to the credit union monthly. I was beginning to save funds, but in late XX/XX/XXXX I had two family members : ( 1 ) one who is now deceased ; and ( 2 ) another who has experienced severe health issues where I had to assist with other family members in burial costs and other expenses.

I called in to ask questions, the representative on the phone didn''t even offer me the opportunity to apply per their process.

This is wrong. I meet the criteria for a Direct Deposit Assistance, especially since no credit checks are involved.');

Received letter of Debt through Spouse who they allowed to stay in Apartment for 3 months without paying rent. First her lawyer mentioned I should pay but an agreement was made for all Parties to to pay half. I therefore did that as part of the separation agreement, it was paid in person. After 3 years and apparently after ex spouse did not pay her amount I was served with a notice, but even as tried to just clear up the difference, realized the amount was wrong. I then asked from both the creditor and Apartment for my payment history which no one wants to provide. I did this multiple times by phone and in letter, I also sent a official request for validation of the debt and am waiting. 

Since then even before giving me a validation I have been brought to court which I again stated my position and am now facing trial by jury. Meanwhile my ex spouse was sued in XX/XX/XXXX and a payment agreement reached. So she was not at this court hearing or is required to go to trial for the same debt we are both on. With that I document ed the times I called, I was told by the Apartment Supervisor that indeed I did pay half of the amount they first sued my ex for, so i mentioned she contact the law office to notify them of this since they admitted they were never made aware. In that very call she hung up on me when I asked for a written document. I legally recorded tall correspondences with both the Apartment and creditors. Since sending a letter to the creditors asking them for the corrected amount if any and that the Supervisor XXXX at XXXX XXXX could verify, no traction. 

I called the Apartments Back and appear the Creditors Kenneth E Davidson Law Office has adviced their client to just tell me to call them and that the amount owed is after I paid Half. Which could not be the case based of what you will see in the documents I attach. No one has up till now provided a validation of any debt even after all this. I have Mortgage company back in XX/XX/XXXX asking me for the number to verify that indeed I followed the Separation Agreement and paid Half will attach that email. 

Excuses from the XXXX client, XXXX XXXX has been it is in a vault they can''t get to my payment history right away. The Supervisor had some but I needed to talk to her lawyer. Needless to say I would call the creditors and they would tell me call the apartments, have apartments call them. I would call the Apartments they would say there was either no reason to talk to the lawyers, or from the Supervisor call them, when I told her what the Creditors Kenneth E Davidson Law office said. 

All communication has been notes and I have had a certified third party transcript the audio. I have legal emails mentioning the first time i heard of the amount, which I paid half. I also will attach all this to this complaint. 

I have been trying to work with this creditor since XX/XX/XXXX. I have only been able to add some documents here because of the size limit. I have added in order numbers for the transcripts. I have copies of recordings when needed. Since colorado recordings are legal of the person doing it, if the call is theirs. The legal document she received has a different amount from the one I received, that too has not been validated. 

Also I have added the apartment receipts showing rental amount, 3 times {$720.00} doesn''t make XXXX dollars. I only have 2 of those receipts. also added here. of.To purchase my home I have had extensive credit check done back in XX/XX/XXXX for me to be able to, including inquiry into this matter, they specifically wanted to call and clarify. That email asking about this added. Where i lived, in end of XX/XX/XXXX. I had no lease. 

Communication has been Law firm tells me ask Apartment to call them, Apartment has told me there is no reason to call or have the Law Office call them. Basicall a Ping Pong effect and getting nowhere. Because of the limits here not documents have been added but am ready to had over more on request if you guys are able to help me.');

This is simply a case where this company agreed to a specific amount and are now trying to get more outside the scope of the XXXX agreement. This is nothing more than a Fraudulent attempt to reneg on their agreement with CCC. They are willfully trying to extort more money from me and trying to harm my credit because I am refusing to pay anymore than the amount that was agreed upon. My account is supposed to be reported to the credit bureaus as paid on time based on the terms and conditions of the XXXX agreement. I now may have to remove them completely from the XXXX program, default on the loan and leave them with nothing since they want to be greedy about this. Why continue to pay them an agreed upon amount each month for them to report as late or past due. This company has been found guilty of fraud int he past, they have agreed to pay multi-millions in fines because they opened up fraudulent accounts and now they want to pull this on me? Unacceptable.');

Re : Courtesy Reminder from Bridge Lending Sun, XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) To : you ( XXXX ) + 1 more Details Dear Lender, It has come to my attention that payday lenders must be licensed by the state of Alabama in order to offer loans to its residents. Since your company has no license in my state, the loan contract I have with you is not valid. Although I am not legally required to do so, I am willing to repay the principal balance of this loan. To date, I received a deposit of {$250.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and have paid {$31000.00} back.. This results in an over payment of {$62.00} At this time I am requesting a return email acknowledging that my loan has been paid in full. Also, I would like a refund of the {$62.00} over payment. A refund check of {$62.00} should be mailed to me at the address you have on file.

My family was looking for an other place to live. 
When I was working, I saw someone came to the store all the time, and I Saw she is XXXX like me, we start to talk, but she speaks English and I didn''t, she told me she will rent a big space so we can live together. 
She took me somewhere to show me an office ( XXXX XXXX ) XXXX XXXX XXXX, and she said that''s where we are going to live. When I called my brother he was affraid for me, cause I just got here, he didn''t want someone to abuse me. He said you don''t really know the lady, if something happens to you, I won''t know cause it''s too far away for me, I just got an apartment for you close to your kids school, the same day I went to my brothers apartment with my kids. I went to the office to let them know that I got somewhere else to stay, so I won''t be with the lady in this place.they told me ok, I will take your name off.so the office know that I never live there. I told them that as soon as I get it, before their apartment was available. 

I am surprised on XX/XX/2018. I received a letter from the creditor : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Attn : leasing office XXXX XXXX FL XXXX For the amount of {$4500.00} The office know that I wasn''t there. 
They know who exactly they supposed to go after, why they choose to go after me? is it because I didn''t understand English too much and I can not defend myself? When I went to the office to tell them why they do that to me.the office told me that she brought a guy to sign for her after I took my name off, and the guy come back to take off his name, so the office told me that''s why they keep my name in case the lady does not pay so they will have someone to go after, the office retain my info with out my consent to go after when things go wrong for the lady, why they are protecting the lady, I don''t know, why the office didn''t retain the guy info to go after him too, I don''t know, but the office knows, I got the of the person that I talked to.hepl me out please, cause I need justice. I didn''t have any contact with them. 
Thank you.');

They used the strong armed tactic threatening my credit even after I explained this is a double bill. Then Receivable Management Corporation put this {$29.00} against my credit report.

Background : So I lived in XXXX XXXX for 3 years. 2 years in one apartment and transferred to another apartment due to hurricane damage on the 1st apartment.

I had renters insurance for both of these apartments. I moved out of the 1st apartment on XX/XX/2018, and moved out of the second apartment in XXXX XXXX Issues : My father got a call from Iq data who then handed the phone to me. They were stating that they are a collection agency collecting debt for XXXX XXXX and that I owed them XXXX dollars for carpet damage on the first apartment. I told them that this charge was fraudulent because I didn''t receive any information from XXXX or Iq Data about these claims until this phone call which was over a year later. I demand that they give me documentation on these claim however the first employee refused, stating that she wasn''t able to disclose any information provided to her from their client XXXX XXXX. I got frustrated, then told her that I wanted to talk to her supervisor. 

The supervisor comes on the phone and explains that if I wanted documentation I need to write them a letter requesting information and send it to their p.o. box. However, she says this may take a while and that there is interest on the debt, an obvious tactic to get me to pay right then and there. I keep demanding the documentation to be sent a faster way such as email. I state that if I don''t get any documentation they will be hearing from an attorney. She chuckles and says you are gon na call a lawyer over XXXX dollars? She then proceeds to treat me like I am an unresponsible poor person who is just stalling to not pay their debts and then threatens me stating that if i don''t pay my debts my granter ''s ( who are my parents ) credit score will be lowered. I am beyond irate at this point and told her " Do you seriously think I can''t pay the XXXX dollars and I''m stalling for time? '''' She says " then pay the debt ''''. This went on and on. 

Eventually, because I was so angry out of my mind I gave her my debit information to prove the point I could. She hung up on me the second she got it. Obviously, I cancel the transaction as fast as possible. I then called XXXX XXXX to see what was going on. First time I talked to the manager who then said I should call back an hour later because someone else was in charge of dealing with the collection agencies. So that was what I did she picked up and said to call back tomorrow because their computers '' weren''t working. I then remembered that I had a call from my renter insurance agency stating that XXXX made a claim with them over that same carpet. I called my insurance company for documentation on that claim and lo and behold they did. 

So not only are these companies making fraudulent claims but they have broken FDCPA laws in the process. They contacted my parents before they contacted me and they stated this is because they only had my parents number which isn''t true my number is on the lease and I haven''t changed my phone number in eight years. They refused to provide documentation giving me no way to know the legitimacy of such claims from over a year ago. They use an abusive and threatening form of speech to mental and emotional manipulate me into paying the debt. These companies are law-breaking companies as of which should be punished as one.');

This is in response to the numerous calls I have received from your company. Be advised, this is not a refusal to pay, but a notice sent pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 USC 1692g Sec. 809 ( b ) that your claim is disputed and validation is requested. 

This is NOT a request for " verification '''' or proof of my mailing address, but a request for VALIDATION made pursuant to the above-named Title and Section. I respectfully request that your office provide me with competent evidence that I have any legal obligation to pay you. 

Please provide me with the following : What the money you say I owe is for ; Explain and show me how you calculated what you say I owe ; Provide me with copies of any papers that show I agreed to pay what you say I owe ; Provide a verification or copy of any judgment if applicable ; Identify the original creditor ; Prove the Statute of Limitations has not expired on this account ; Show me that you are licensed to collect in my state ; and Provide me with your license numbers and Registered Agent. 
If your offices have reported invalidated information to any of the three major Credit Bureau ''s ( XXXX, XXXX  or XXXX  ), said action might constitute fraud under both Federal and State Laws. Due to this fact, if any negative mark is found on any of my credit reports by your company or the company that you represent I will not hesitate in bringing legal action against you for the following : Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act Violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act Defamation of Character Also during this validation period, if any action is taken which could be considered detrimental to any of my credit reports, I will consult with my legal counsel. This includes any information to a credit reporting repository that could be inaccurate or invalidated or verifying an account as accurate when in fact there is no provided proof that it is. 

If your offices fail to respond to this validation request within 30 days from the date of your receipt, all references to this account must be deleted and completely removed from my credit file and a copy of such deletion request shall be sent to me immediately. 
I would also like to request, in writing, that no telephone contact be made by your offices to my home or to my place of employment. If your offices attempt telephone communication with me, including but not limited to computer generated calls or correspondence sent to any third parties, it will be considered harassment and I will have no choice but to file suit. All future communications with me MUST be done in writing and sent to the address noted in this letter. 
This is an attempt to correct your records, any information obtained shall be used for that purpose.');

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a message from XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX through XXXX, the debt I allegedly owe was reduced {$1000.00} Down to {$0.00}, however when I called to confirm, they stated that I still owe the alleged debt. 

Once I gave her the information required through her questioning, she said do I know why my mail is being returned from that address. Then she reaffirmed her statement by saying what I am trying to say is we are trying to mail to this address and your post master is sending back that I don '''' t live there. 

On XX/XX/XXXX at approximately XXXX XXXX, on a recorded line, Gold Key Credit Inc. used misleading information alleged that the postmaster is sending back their mail and that I don''t live at the address. Then she said that you are advising me that this must be an error and this is your current mailing address. I never stated anything about my address being an error. 

Then when asking her why did they reduce the amount from {$1000.00} down to {$0.00} she said they did not reduce the amount and the balance is still owed, however XXXX admitted other phone that, that information came directly from the creditor XXXX   XXXX XXXX/Gold Key Credit back on XX/XX/XXXX. And I saw written prove on XXXX and XXXX XXXX which is attached to this complaint Then she said that validation was sent of XX/XX/XXXX, but she just said that postmaster said that I did not live at that address so how is this possible. And her response was we cant be accountable if the mail was return, however I have 3 responses from that they sent through the mail. She also stated that I have a cease and desist on my account and they are not going to be sending me anything. I explain which I am sure the agency knows the validation specifically state only to do written correspondences which is another misleading statement. 

I inquired as to why they decreased the debt down to XXXX  and she stated that she did not notify the credit bureau that your balance was XXXX.');

I do not dispute that XXXX rendered these services. However, they failed to correctly diagnose and repair the problem. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I realized that my XXXX-brand washing machine was no longer draining properly, leaving my clothes soaking wet at the end of every wash cycle. A XXXX repairman came to my house on XXXX, took a look at the machine, ran some repairs, and stated that the problem was fixed. However, it soon became apparent that the machine was not working significantly better than it had been before the repairs. After doing some research and running some diagnostics, I concluded that the machine had a problem that the repairman had failed to notice, let alone resolve. Repairing this problem would have required some expensive spare parts, and since it was a very old machine, I decided to get rid of it and purchase a new one. 

Over the course of the following months, XXXX sent me a number of bills for the amount of {$200.00}. After each bill, I contacted XXXX, and explained that they had failed to resolve my problem, and therefore I should not be obliged to pay. I contacted them by phone ( XXXX ) on XXXX after the first bill, by email ( XXXX ) on XXXX after the second bill, and by physical mail several months later ( I do not recall the exact date ) after the third bill. After this, they send me a letter acknowledging my appeal, and requested that I send a statement to XXXX, which I did on XXXX. In each one of these communications, I gave a detailed explanation of why I was not satisfied with their services, and why I should not be obliged to pay. After sending this final email, I did not hear anything more about the matter until XX/XX/XXXX, when I received a letter from RMS, stating that XXXX had placed them in charge of collecting this debt. I immediately sent RMS both an email and a physical letter explaining why I considered the debt invalid. Earlier today ( XX/XX/XXXX ), I received a second letter from RMS, stating that they did not consider my appeal valid, and that I was still expected to pay {$200.00}. 

I am attaching the emails that I have sent to XXXX and to RMS, in order to demonstrate that I have made every effort to resolve this issue. Neither XXXX nor RMS has responded to these messages in any meaningful way -- they have simply repeated their requests that I pay for the service, without acknowledging the reason why I do not feel obliged to do so.');

I put enough money into that houses account to pay the mortgage for a year. After 3 months I received mail that the house was in foreclosure. I immediately tried to log in to pay the past due amounts but was unable to, and was told to speak with Freedom ''s attorneys. 

After speaking with the attorneys, they sent me a reinstatement letter from Freedom Mortgage, which listed the past due amount, along with a laundry list of additional fees that were never explained. The past due amount was roughly {$5000.00} - however they tacked on another {$5000.00} in fees. Getting nowhere on answers from them, I decided to hire my own attorneys. 

My attorneys could not get answers from Freedom ''s attorneys or Freedom Mortgage for months. We unfortunately had no record of the autopay setup, so my attorneys pretty much said that they can keep fighting this - however it will likely result in the house foreclosing. I basically had two options, let the house foreclose due to the ridiculous amount of fees Freedom wanted to collect, or suck it up and pay all the fees so that my credit didn''t get destroyed. 

So after a whole year of back and forth and getting no answers from Freedom, I finally decided to stop all the bleeding from both sides. The past due mortgage payments were {$17000.00}. I was happy to pay that. However in order to get the loan reinstated, I had to pay them {$26000.00}. The rest were all their fees. This does not include what I paid to my attorneys to try to get this whole issue resolved. 

All I wanted the entire time was to talk to someone at Freedom about the fees and see if there was a fair resolution given the circumstances. I am incredibly displeased with how this whole thing transpired.');

This debt was paid on XX/XX/XXXX 2  days before it was sent to collection and I called to tell them that. I also told them to contact the XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX to confirm that this debt had been paid. Wakefield and Associates refused to do this saying that it was our responsibility to pay this.

Therefore, I contacted our XXXX credit union the bank that issued our bank card used to pay this debt. XXXX emailed me a copy of the transaction proving that the debt had been paid. I called Wakefield and Associates back within 30 minutes of our initial conversation and told them to send me an email address so I could forward XXXX information to end this debt harassment and not to contact us again about the matter again.

Today XX/XX/XXXX, I get a new letter from Wakefield and Associates saying that we now own them a different amount from XXXX XXXX XXXX   XXXX  for {$57.00} and stating that we did not send them proof of the payment in the question above. All of a sudden, the amount has changed from {$110.00} after we proved we paid them.

We have never had another bill from them. Attached is an actual bill from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and the XXXX statement. Wakefield and Associates are harassing us and trying to get payments that are not due. In addition, they over-inflated the initial charges that should have been owed.

About a year later, XXXX, Barclay bank filed a lawsuit which I was not given any notice of to dispute, just a date for court, which resulted in my income taxes being garnished for over a thousand dollars.

My goal was to payoff a higher interest rate loan. I authorized BB & T to Debit my DDA for the Payoff Amount and received a confirmation number and days later a confirmation Letter indicating the payment to my Home Equity Line had occurred.When my XX/XX/XXXX statement came it showed BB & T SPLIT the XX/XX/XXXX Payment and credited a portion to my Home Equity Term Loan ( which carries a lower rate ) and applied the remained to my Home Equity Line ( which carries a higher rate ). 

The result of BB & T splitting my payment allowed them to keep a balance on the higher rate loan rather than paying it off as I requested. 

For two weeks I made 7 calls to BB & T to correct their decision to Split my payment which kept a balance on the higher rate loan. 

Finally, I involved North Carolina ''s Office of Commissioner of Banks. 

So, after 7 phone calls to BB & T and my contacting North Carolina ''s Office of Commissioner of Banks on XX/XX/XXXX the Split Payment was reversed and Applied to my higher rate Home Equity Line as I requested on XX/XX/XXXX. 

HOWEVER, due to BB & T Splitting the XX/XX/XXXX payment the Authorized Automated Home Equity Term Loan Payment due for XX/XX/XXXX was not processed by BB & T ''s Account System. Then when BB & T Reversed the Split Payment on XX/XX/XXXX - BB & T did not process the Authorized Automated Home Equity Term Loan Payment for XX/XX/XXXX - they just left the Home Equity Term Loan Past Due. 

The result was - I received a Collection Call and a Collection Letter threaten Credit Bureau Reporting for a past due payment on my Home Equity Term Loan - which all occurred due to BB & T Splitting my payment request in order to keep the higher rate Home Equity Line with a loan balance and charge a higher rate of interest and charge late fees. 

I have BB & T documentation which confirms this tragic occurrence of a Big Bank ''s effort to swindle and take advantage of a consumer.');

And, because we only get paid at the beginning of each month, that is when we sit down and pay our bills. By the end of the month, there''s no more money until the next month. 

When we pay bills, especially if it is a credit card, we take the minimum due and round it up to the nearest 100 dollars like so : XX/XX/2019 ACH Transaction - Synchrony CHECK PYMT XXXX ACH Debit On XX/XX/2019 at XXXX XXXX, Synchrony ( XXXX ) called to collect on a debt. It was an automated call, so I hung up and called back to see who the call was coming from. So, I ignored the next four calls : XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, then again XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX. 

After confirming payment went through the bank ( above ), I called them back at XXXX XXXX and after the automated system confirmed payment and that the next payment due was not until XX/XX/2019, I stayed on the line to speak with a human. I flustered the young man who took my call. So much so that he agreed no more phone calls, but I could not get anything else out of him, so I hung up on him. That call lasted 7 minutes and 36 seconds. They record all of their calls. I suggest you get a copy of the call. 

I informed the young man that if a company accepts payment - of which they are claiming was a partial payment of which I strongly disagree - whether it is the full amount or not, if the company accepts payment, they can not expect more money before the end of the billing period. The young man did not understand other than to agree to put a note on my account not to call again. 

But that is not the problem. My bill came in under {$200.00} and now they''re wanting another {$380.00} BEFORE XX/XX/XXXX. However, the automated system is not asking for that amount until the due date of XX/XX/XXXX.');

There was also a few dollar fee to do so which worried me about even more about the dollar amount shown right from the gate. I was skeptical so I tried to cancel the loan and give the money back. I was told I could not do this. I asked a few months later in XXXX for a copy of the loan agreement because the interest rate somehow jumped approximately 5 % from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX.

The individual calling did not acknowledge his name or the name of the Entity in which he was calling from, in violation of of 15 U.S.C 1692d ( 6 ). I was unable to talk at the time of the initial call, so i called back and spoke with a young lady by the name of XXXX. 

I verified with her my name, and the number in which i was calling from. upon locating a reference number, XXXX would not continue the call unless I provided her with additional personal information which i refused to due.

There was a " robo-call '''' message on my voice mail stating that the call was looking for XXXX XXXX, who is my brother. I did not retrieve the message until XX/XX/19. I called the number back on XX/XX/19 for the sole purpose of telling them that I have nothing to do with any debt for XXXX XXXX, and to remove my phone number from their system, and to not make any further calls to me. The first call was placed at XXXX eastern, and was answered by a gentleman who did not, and would not provide his name, nor would he provide the name of the company he was calling from. When he answered my call, he requested my name, and I told him I would not provide my name, that he was looking for someone for whom I have no responsibility for his debt. He asked me to tell him how to get in contact with XXXX XXXX, and I told him that was not my problem. He responded by telling me that they would keep calling until I responded. I again asked for his name and the name of his company, which again, he would not provide. The entire conversation, he was talking over me, so I don''t know that he heard anything I had to say, since he wasn''t listening. Finally he said " have a blessed day '''' twice and hung up on me.

I called for the second time at XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/19, this time I reached a woman I don''t recall her giving me her name, but she did tell me the name of the company wad XXXX. I asked her what XXXX  stands for, and she would not tell me, and hung up on me.

I called for the third time at XXXX  on XX/XX/19, and immediately asked for a supervisor. I was transferred to a gentleman who told me his name is XXXX XXXX. He confirmed the name of the company is actually DRS, and that it stood for Direct Recovery Services. I advised him that this was my third call to the company, and that I am calling to advise that I have nothing to do with XXXX ''s debt, and I wanted my phone number removed from their system, and I did not want any further phone calls from their company. He assured me that the number was already removed. I went through the entire thing again, asking him to confirm that my number was removed. He confirmed that it was.

Unfortunately, I have had similar issues with accounts that belong to my brother from other agencies, and it takes multiple contacts to actually get my phone number removed. I am filing this complaint because of their inappropriate tactics, they need to respond appropriately when they are called, not talk over callers and refuse to give their names and the name of their company.');

They made a decision without informing me of anything and submitted me to collections. They never even sent me any documentation stating how they came to their conclusion. By the time I found out I was already in collections. I paid my bill a month in advance for over a year so not only did they take the credit on file.

I was advised that I am being charged for accelerated rent for XX/XX/2014. I advised them that I need them to send proof of why they are trying to collect wrongfully unauthorized charges. They sent me a copy of a lease that was completely falsified. I called them back and told them I never seen that lease and the dates of the lease are incorrect and the charges in the ledger are not accurate. I previously had a dispute with that creditor many years ago for wrongfully reporting made up charges which resulted in deletion off rental history. They advised that they will not remove the reporting unless it is verified inaccurate by leasing company. I asked what if they stand by their false charges and no one had anything to say. I pleaded with them to remove reporting until this is resolved as this is the only negative thing on my credit and it is hurting me drastically and unfair to have a reporting that is not true reporting on my credit. They refused to remove reporting. I think it this is very unfair. They have not verified the legality of this charges so why are they reporting a collection account on my account? I never even lived at that place during those dates. These charges are fraudulent.');

Now, After almost 4 Years I got a call from a new company Phoenix Financial Service and they also gave me a discounted price which I am ready to pay. 
They also reported this to credit agencies as service date as XX/XX/XXXX and my credit score is reduced due to this. So, this Derogatory mark should be removed from my account.');

I recently discovered an erroneous collection account on my credit file from a collection agency named XXXX XXXX XXXX. I have no knowledge of this debt.

Approximately 30 days ago I sent a letter asking for valid proof to the reporting collection company, XXXX XXXX XXXX. To date my letter has been ignored and their fraudulent collection practices continue, also a clear violation of the FCRA. 

The failure to comply and positively verify this account has violated my consumer and civil rights and has damaged my ability to obtain credit. Under the FCRA, unverified accounts must be removed and if you are unable to provide a copy of verifiable proof, the account must be removed immediately. My demand is the immediate and permanent removal of these erroneous accounts from all three credit bureaus. If this is not accomplished immediately, I am prepared to protect my legal rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act by retaining a consumer protection Attorney.');

( For consumers with a contract date later in XXXX, the amount would be significantly more. ) However, if the amount is properly pro-rated on XX/XX/XXXX for this first five year cycle, we agree in the future we would owe the full amount every five years on XX/XX/XXXX, as it would cover a full 5 years of ownership. 

We contacted Concord directly, who referred us to their customer, XXXX XXXX regarding any billing errors. We were told by XXXX XXXX that " all Refurbishing Fees are due at the beginning of the calendar year '''' and that they would not pro-rate the fee for the partial year. When I pointed out that the contract did not allow them to bill early, we were told that was the way all contracts were managed and if we failed to pay the amount in full as billed, our contract would be placed in default. This would not only prevent us from using the property, but also puts the amount we paid for the property ( over {$120000.00} ) at risk. At no time was anyone impolite ; they were simply firm with their position, would not debate it, and were clear about the consequences. This left us with little option than to file this complaint. 

To keep our contract in good standing, we are going to pay the fee as billed. However we are also filing this complaint with the CFPB for unethical and inaccurate billing practices.');

I was working a lot of hours and forgot to make the payment on it. I never received any phone calls or letters from the store or company at all after taking out the loan, so I forgot about it completely. That is until a sheriffs deputy showed up at my house to serve me with paperwork for court. I contacted XXXX XXXX in XXXX TN - the firm listed on the paperwork - regarding the paperwork and was informed that it was due to the flex loan with XXXX XXXX. They told me the only way to avoid court - and garnishments and other negative information showing up on my credit report - was to setup payments with them of a minimum of {$200.00} per month. That was more than I could reasonably afford - and there was no debt to income analysis done - but since I wished to avoid all of the negative consequences and I was unaware at the time that I could have possibly obtained better terms if I went to court, I agreed and have been paying them {$200.00} per month by bank draft since then - all without STIILL receiving any paperwork stating how much I owed originally or how much my remaining balance is. 

I have been trying for over two weeks at this point to make my next payment and have been unable to reach anyone at XXXX XXXX to take my payment or to get anyone to call me back. I have even reached out to my local XXXX XXXX location for help in reaching them and all they could offer was to keep calling the number - and that the law office was in the same building as the XXXX XXXX corporate office. 

I know that I took out the loan, but I feel that XXXX XXXX took unreasonable advantage of this situation by not notifying me of my debts and payments. Furthermore, I have attempted in every way to keep up my agreement, but XXXX XXXX is not making themselves available to keep up their end and accept my payments and causing me undue stress about my situation in the process. And, I still have no idea how much I owe, if my loan has been properly moved to default, if I have any further options, etc. All in all, these two companies manipulated and bullied to take advantage of the situation.');

I had paperless billing which means you can only access your statements online. However, once you cancel, you can no longer access your account! it took months for a representative to finally provide me with the final bill. Much to my dismay, it showed a contract cancellation charge, which never should have been. I have tried for months to get this corrected and get my true final billing. Unfortunately it is nearly impossible to speak with someone that is not in an off-shore call center and they just repeat scripted responses!

Now just recently I had my credit report done and found a negative issue about an outstanding medical bill that was in collections. I went to the Hospital to investigate and found that my bills had been paid in full by XXXX. But there was one bill that was separate from their billing and it was from a XXXX XXXX. I found out that XXXX XXXX tired to bill my XXXX, but had waited to long in his request and XXXX refused to pay. Then he tried billing me at an incorrect address for the charges. As a results I never received any billing, because he was sending it to an address that I didn''t live at. After never getting a repsonse from me her turned it over to a collection agency in turn reported it to my credit report as none payment. ( Paramount Recovery Systems out of Texas ) I reported my dispute with 2 Credit Reporting Agency ( XXXX  and XXXX ) and had the negative issue delete from my credit Report. 
I am waited for a response from XXXX  on my dispute. I would like this collection agency to stop reporting a negative issue on my credit.

How can a charged off debt over 10 years old be purchased? It was not purchased and this collection post is a complete fraud perpetuated against XXXX, and an abuse of my rights under FCRA and FDCPA. The attached post on my credit bureau claims that a debt was purchased by a third party. At no time from my initial dispute was a debt validated. Under Federal Trade Commission guidelines, a debt must be proved, showing actual hard copy transfer. That does not mean a letter of transfer, but an actual transfer with signature backup. The debt purchase industry is the largest scam ongoing against the American consumer. Both the collection agency/debt purchaser are in violation of their subscriber agreement with every credit reporting agency. At no time was the debt validated, and the initial timeline from the original creditor has been cut off, and thus the debt is illegally being re-aged to benefit both the original creditor and the illegal debt collection process. Both the original trade line must be removed along with the invalid collection process. This problem will continue to exist since the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Supreme Court decision of XX/XX/XXXX, whereas the third party purchase voids the individuals rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. Since there is no proof of true hard copy transfer and ownership, the collection is VOID and the collection process must cease and my file for both accounts must purge. These items must be deleted permanently and my files need to be purged. My information was obtained through a debt pooling process that should be terminated by the Federal Trade Commission. XXXX XXXX has committed a fraudulent act by even posting my antiquated information and there should be sanctions taken against this company.

I was unclear who they were as I never received a correspondence from them nor AAFES about any debt. The representative on the phone had a very intimidating and condescending tone and threatened to garnish my wages if I did not make a payment that moment - insisting they have permission to collect payments even if it was an over payment. It was my responsibility to call them for a refund. 

My next pay check amount was nearly 100 % garnished. I had still never received any written correspondence from either the collection company or AAFES. I also did not receive a pay amount or any correspondence sent to my home. 

Letters were sent to my chain of command multiple times - that I did not even receive until after the payments were garnished from my paycheck. This means my whole entire command knew of a debt before I knew and BEFORE I could even verify it was valid. I was verbally accused I was not managing my finances from my superior after the letter was handed to me. 

Even while the payments were being garnished, I received a minimum of 10 calls per day until I was afraid to answer calls from an unknown number. I was also afraid to make any necessary purchases - not knowing how much money would be in my paycheck even if the alleged debt was paid. As it was stated before, it was my responsibility to wait for the collector to call me back and request a refund, then wait for a check to be sent to me. 

Additionally, my recent knowledge AAFES '' class action lawsuit in XXXX, gave me the courage to speak up about the injustice I faced as a military service member. I believe I was subjected to illegal collection practices from AAFES ''s use of administrative offset - a procedure whereby federal payments, such as social security, veterans '' benefits, and tax refunds are withheld to collect debt.');

My mother was a XXXX XXXX and as I was in the XXXX, she used my information to acquire services under my name, like Cable TV and now this. We didn''t know until things started to pop up. She died last year of complications from XXXX/XXXX. I did my investigation and she got this XXXX account because the representative at a mall kiosk in PR was her friend and they used my info for her to get 2 cell phones. That employee no longer works there. I have told them the same thing over a dozen times and provided them with all the information. They said they will take it of my report. This has been going on for a while now and they continue to reach out to me. My credit score went down in a huge way thats to them pushing this in to my report and my house buying process is now at a stop due to this. Please, this is getting overwhelming and as I dig in the web, there is nothing but stories and complaints from this company.

Consumer is formally notifying debt collector ( Sunrise Credit Services , Inc. ) of legal reason ''s why consumer has rights to dispute debt and refuse to pay a debt consumer does not owe. ( 1 ). Consumer has no fiduciary or contractual obligation to a third party debt collector because there is no exchange of any benefit or detriment with ANY future collection agencies, junk debt buyers ( JDB ) or collection law firms. There will be no enforceable agreement. No payment history, nor products, or services has been rendered to such entities because these elements do not exist ; there is a ''failure of consideration '' and no valid agreement, contract or fiduciary obligation under federal law that requires payment to such parties. ( 2 ). Consumers sole income is Social Security income which is federally protected income under the Social Security Administration Act ( SSA ) ; Sec. 207. [ 42 U.S.C. 407 ] ( a ). Consumer has a copy of consumers Social Security Award letter as proof positive protected income. Please be advised : Under compilation of the Social Security Laws Section 207 [ 42 U.S.C. 407 ] ( a ) which states : the right of any person to any future payment under this title shall NOT be transferable or assignable, at law or in equity, and none of the moneys paid or payable or rights existing under this title shall be subject to execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or other legal process, or the operation of any bankruptcy or insolvency law., whether consumer gives permission or not a consumer does not have the authority to authorize garnishment of a federally protected account. Under Nebraska Revised Statute Section 25-1563.01. ; the same Supreme Court ruling applies in this matter. ( 3 ). Consumers protected income presents a genuine issue of material fact that if a summary judgment is granted ( after receipt of this formal notification ) it shall be construed as a deceptive, frivolous, abusive and harassing process that can garner monetary retribution for consumer. Consumer is impoverished and refuses to be a victim of unjust enrichment and extortive tactics. Furthermore, a federal ( and civil ) lawsuit will ensue if consumers Social Security income is tampered with after receipt of this formal notice. Consumer thanks the CFPB for all it does to mediate and protect the rights of Consumer ''s in this venue. Consumer will NOT respond to any ( PERSONAL ) emails from representatives of Sunrise Credit Services , Inc., sent to consumer beyond the " CFPB consumer portal '''' ... ... due to a personal email provided in this venue.');

In XXXX XXXX XXXX, we had a 15 yr. loan @ 13 % with XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, & XXXX and the maturity of the loan was XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 

Each of the before mentioned finance companies ALL were frankly taken over by XXXX. 

After falling behind on taxes, it was made good in a court action, to which back taxes were brought current in a chapter XXXX proceeding. In the repayment plan, XXXX XXXX XXXX. also collected over {$17000.00}, {$12000.00}, and over {$5000.00} in lump sums, in addition to my monthly payments of {$2000.00}. 

Now that everything was current, while in court, the Trustee also approved the Payoff Application that I made to XXXX, while we were in Court XXXX agreed. Only it was a Ploy/stalling tactic to move out of the " Eyes '''' of the law. After court, XXXX resumed taking monthly payments, but XXXX NEVER resumed sending the official " Statements '''' as required by Law. 

None of the Lump sum totals Mentioned above are reflected on our loan account from XXXX, after I requested a summary of my account with them. 

In XXXX, I paid an undertaking of {$10000.00} to XXXX XXXX XXXX office. Now, this lump sum, I was told by XXXX XXXX XXXX office that this Lump sum was going to be applied to the Balloon payment becoming due XX/XX/XXXX. 

Again, the facts relating to ALL the Lumps sums paid were hidden and NEVER applied to my account. Even with the breakdown of specific fees relating to attorney fees and related court cost, none of my lump sum payments are posted on my account. 

I have ordered the bank records and the chapter XXXX & XXXX records. Subsequently, XXXX record does not reflect payments made through the Chapters either. 

In XXXX, XXXX transferred us while officially in the midst of a Modification. IT is worth mentioning again, XXXX continued to accept monthly payments, but a XXXX Workout Specialist verbally said they didn''t know what to do with my account because after XXXX XXXX, XXXX they were not obligated to send out " Monthly Statements. '''' I was confused by this because I felt I should know how the money that I continued to send, was going to be applied. In XXXX XXXX, I was sent notice of an upcoming transfer to XXXX XXXX. 

XXXX XXXX, never sent any documentation of any to our residence. Nor did XXXX continue with the Modification application. 

In a matter of 8 months, XXXX transferred the Debt to XXXX XXXX  with notice. Ever since then, No one has given us an documentation that reflects an accurate record to include ALL of the above amounts paid. 

Moreover, Its like a Con-job/SCAM more than anything! I have been finically harmed and deceived, plus subjected to harassment! 

West Coast Serving has never provided me with servicing. In fact, Section 5 of RESPA ( 12 U.S.C.S ) 2605 gives the consumer rights. 

Given the laws on the books to protect consumers, it is my legal right to submit as truth and fact, that I was never given any proper/official Not of Transfer as required by law. 

West Coast Servicing, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX intentionally violated the law and must STILL be held to accountable to the Law according to Section 6 of RESPA. 

Further, the law provides for damages and cost for individuals where Servicers are shown to have violated the requirements of this section according to transfer Practices and Requirements. 

Please note, West Coast Servicing has never sent any documentation reflecting ANY of the above payments previously made to XXXX. 

It is my firm belief and testimony that XXXX has never correctly applied money paid to their representing attorney XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and further the additional monies paid thereafter up until XXXX, and in XXXX, we prepaid our property taxes. 

Now, our property taxes are once again delinquent. Plus, we are experiencing roof leaks from the serve weather and our heating unit is in need of immediate replacement. 

Since all the repairs are costly, We are stuck between a rock and hard spot because we need a home equity loan to address all the repairs needed that''s also long over due. 

West Coast Servicing and XXXX have violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.');

The call itself was news to me since I had not received any notification in the mail of any debts owed. The call was also highly suspicious due to there being 1+ minute long pauses in between information being said. 

I called the number back and found out that XXXX XXXX had sent my account to collections. After I found out the information I needed to I told them not to contact me again or I would take legal action. 

I immediately called XXXX XXXX to ask what was going on, since I had an agreement ( or so I thought ) and payments were being made each month to pay down the balance. At this time I also paid the balance off in full directly to XXXX XXXX and requested a letter that showed this. The letter was sent the following day on XX/XX/19. 

I followed up with CPA telling them that there was no longer any money owed to XXXX XXXX, and that I am requesting that they remove all information they have about myself from their system. The refused. 

I spoke to someone in client services at CPA and was told they would call XXXX XXXX right now to confirm the payment and would call me back, neither of those things happened. 

A few days after the 24th a letter finally arrived notifying me of the debt, which at this point had already been paid. I disregarded it as I was still waiting at this point for the woman from client services to call me back and I had a letter from XXXX XXXX telling me it was paid. 

Fast forward to today XX/XX/19 and I have received a second letter from CPA identical to the first. The first one is dated XX/XX/19 the second XX/XX/19, They send a second letter to me before I even received the first one.

So I called CPA back to speak to someone about why they still have my information in their system and why they have sent me this second letter that they sent out a day after the debt was paid. I asked to speak to a supervisor and they transferred me to a phone line that rings once and then just stays open on the other end. This happened to me 4 times. They had no real intentions of dealing with this situation. 

I finally got a hold of a supervisor name XXXX, who I have spoken to before. Instead of giving me any answers he just referred me to their legal department ( as he had done previously ). However from the first time I know that their legal department is just one person named XXXX. When transferred to her it always goes to voicemail. 

Today I was able to get a hold of XXXX I had the operator keep me on hold until she could get her for me. XXXX however did not want to answer questions and told me that I should be worried about paying my bills on time. This was quite rude as she does not know what has or hasn''t happened with my bills. She then told me that my Girlfriend left me and that I was destitute, again XXXX doesn''t know anything about me so why would she say that? I asked for her bosses name and she refused.');

On XX/XX/XXXX I emailed Pheonix Financial requesting debt validation. On XX/XX/XXXX I called Pheonix Financial. They informed me about a hospital bill from XX/XX/XXXX, for my child, that was in a different state from where we live. I mentioned to Ms. XXXX from Pheonix Financial that I had not recieved any calls or bills from anyone regarding that matter. She told me I can call my insurance company and ask them to pick up the claim. I called my insurance company for more information, they informed me the bill was paid and gave me a electronic check number. I called Ms. XXXX to tell her the good news, and she proceeded to tell me how my insurance covered the hospital portion of the bill but not the physician portion of the bill, so my remaining balance was over {$800.00}. I asked what my options were, who I could contact to resolve the matter, because my son was always covered by insurance, and I do not want to owe anyone money. Her solution ( which she made sure to let me know she was recording at this point ) was to pay a discounted price of over {$600.00}. She also then said my insurance would likely not pick up the claim because of the date of service being over a year old. I explained that I should not be expected to pay a bill I have never been addressed about, nor that is financially my responsibility when my child was covered by health insurance. We disconnected and I called my insurance company. He placed me on hold, and he contacted Phenoix Financial. He came to the resolution that the reason for the bill was because the hospital did not put my childs insurance information in correctly. My insurance says this will take 30-45 business days to be reprocessed, and I will be covered by them fully.');

They call at all hours of the night. Sometimes even at XXXX XXXX. They claim to represent our former residence, ''XXXX XXXX. '' We currently have a new lease with a new condo ( for the last 8 months ). We moved here due to the outstanding rental history and recommendation from XXXX XXXX. Now, a new company has bought XXXX XXXX and is demanding more than {$6000.00}. To this day, I still have no idea as to what it is for. I have asked ideal collections and XXXX  for any type of documentation. They have both refused. Ideal collections fraudulently submitted information to several credit agencies. Thankfully, all of them have recognized this as fraud and have removed it from my almost perfect credit report. XXXX  has refused to remove it. I''m not sure why. I have a credit score well over 700 with everyone else, except for XXXX. I''ve been on the phone with XXXX  numerous times asking them to please remove it. They have since stated that they will re-investigate this obvious fraud. Ideal collections refuses to identify themselves ; location, company identification number, or any type of documentation. This situation has also happened to several other tenants that have left XXXX XXXX. It''s the same company ( ideal collections ), and the same amount. I have also been in contact with my lawyer, the state attoreney ''s office, the XXXX, and of course, the CFPB. Please help me to have this removed from my XXXX credit report. This has gone past the point of harassment. We are also considering taking this issue to law enforcement. For the record, I actually went to XXXX XXXX  in person asking for documentation and as to what this was all about. I was told to leave the property or that they would call the police. Again, I have no idea as to what this is all about. We honored our lease, gave 4 months notice and have lived quietly for the last 8 months at our new place that requires perfect rental history as well as a positive recommendation from our former residence. The same individual from ideal collections has made it clear that he is upset that all other credit agencies have recognized their fraud. He claims that he is going to continue to submit it to XXXX once a week until I wire him ( the amount has since changed ) {$7000.00}. He has recently resubmitted fraudulent information as of XX/XX/XXXX. Again, I would like this removed from my report ( XXXX  ). All of the other credit agencies have been more than willing to help when it comes to these scammers. I have also asked them to stop calling me, yet they continue to do so. I''ve been told by the CFPB that there are currently more than 1,1000 complaints against ideal collections. This does not surprise me. In closing, I find it odd that my wife has not been impacted by this ; she hasn''t received any threats, calls, nor has her credit report been effected even though she was also on the lease as an equal renter at XXXX XXXX.');

This does not substantiate the balance indicated and this should not be in my report this bursar does not show your balance.');

We had one (1) flip-phone, one (1) smart-phone, and one (1) hot-spot;
We went to the XXXX XXXX office in XXXX, Idaho, and paid the remaining balance on the smart-phone, paid our bill, and returned the hot-spot, as it could not be transferred to XXXX XXXX, our new carrier;
The CSR explained they could not credit anything for the hot-spot, as it was not a current model, and I agreed, but had no use for it so gave it back;
I explained why we were switching carriers, and the CSR pulled up our account, we paid the balance, and he assured us our account was closed;
We went across the street to XXXX  and enrolled in XXXX XXXX, transferring our numbers, and obtained a XXXX hot-spot;
A month later, XX/XX/XXXX, I got an E-mail saying my XXXX  bill was due;
We again went to the store and spoke to a "Senior CS" who pulled up our account by my SSN, where he saw the account was closed, but with a charge pending; 
I explained what we had done the previous month, so he spoke with the original CSR, removed the charges, and again assured me the matter was resolved and the account was closed;
Then in XX/XX/XXXX, I received a couple of texts from a collection agency regarding "an outstanding XXXX   account";
We were 78 miles away from XXXX, so called the XXXX  store we''ve always dealt with;
I called the store and asked to speak with the Manager;
I called seven (7) times over the next four (4) days... he was not in yet, in a meeting, on another call, or with a customer;
I scheduled a return call with the assistant manager, which was not returned;
We again drove to the same XXXX store, to find the manager was again in another meeting which could not be interrupted;
The CSR got XXXX, the assistant manager, and I again explained the situation to both of them and a couple more employees;
Again, he pulled up my info using my SSN, and told me that as of that time accounts cannot be closed in person, only by calling a toll-free number;
I told him I was never notified of that when we closed our account;
He found everything had been paid in full and cancelled, except the hot-spot;
Apparently, as it was no longer a current model, the CSR had not entered a code number to remove it, so the line charge continued, even though the unit was in XXXX possession;
XXXX verified that no usage had occurred, then he reversed the charges, bringing the account back to XXXX (XXXX);
XXXX assured me he had covered the bases, and would forward all the notes to the manager, XXXX XXXX, who would remove the Collection Activities;
Two (2) days later, I received a Voice Message from XXXX XXXX assuring me the matter was resolved and the Collection Action had been recalled;
He apologized for the problem, and for all the trouble I had gone through to get it resolved;
In XX/XX/XXXX, I got a phone call from IC Systems, a Washington, D.C. debt collector, in regards to the same XXXX account;
Again we drove from Washington State  to the XXXX, Idaho XXXX store, to speak with XXXX XXXX;
I spoke with four (4) CSRs, finally ending up with a new assistant manager who told me both XXXX  and XXXX  were no longer with XXXX, the debt was still pending and in Collections, and XXXX was not able to do anything about it;
I was in the office for over an hour, during which time they refused to get a manager, and refused to give me the manager''s name;
As for resolving the matter, she handed me a card with the address of the XXXX Customer Relations Collection Department on it, and the phone number of the Collection Company;
I sent a letter stating the above to XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, and have heard nothing from them;
On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a call from another Collection Agency; 
When I explained the situation to the person calling, he transferred me to his manager, and I explained everything again;
I told him I was disputing the entire debt, as it was XXXX  mis-handling which caused the entire problem;
The connection was bad, so I asked them to e-mail me their name and contact info, but have as yet not received anything from them;
I do have the phone number (XXXX) the call came in on, but the reverse phone lookup doesn''t tell me the name, only that the number is registered to someone in XXXX, Idaho;
I am retired, on SSN only, with a XXXX  wife to worry about;
I don''t owe this debt, and I want XXXX  to do whatever they have to do to clear it and get my name off the rolls of these and all debt collectors;

No mail was received from them until XX/XX/XXXX. That take me for surprise a lot because I have not had account with XXXX XXXX XXXX. I have not had received any letter from CashCall or XXXX ; for me, this was fishy. So, I summit a complaint to Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with Case Number XXXX-XXXX  on the date of the XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX replied I had no account with them. XXXX replied that they served me and that their collection is from CashCall, now their property. They never validated the debt. They send me a copy of the contract of CashCall without signature, I never signed anything from CashCall. 
I filed a police report on XXXX when my purse was stolen. According to the papers they send to CFPB, the loan was given on XXXX by CashCall, XXXX. XXXX - XXXX bought the loan to CashCall - XXXX in XXXX. XXXX sued me in XX/XX/XXXX, my daughters XXXX and XXXX at the time. I found out about this on the mail in XXXX but ; once again, I did not was served in person as they said, it was on my mail box. It is a win, win, for them because I never knew that I had to go to court. That secured the exorbitant gain of {$12000.00} dollars or {$21000.00} dollars as CashCall contract said, without really knowing and making sure they were suing to the right people. 

You can not sue or, accuse and convict a person with false testimony, based on fraud or identity theft. It is a violation of the law. Hiring court date to win your demand. 

Too late for me to fight and to protect and defense myself from this depredators. I have file an identity theft reports with police, also to the three Credit Bureaus. The latest is : GCFS.Inc renewed the garnish order to XXXX Superior Court Case XXXX. I pulled out a regular mail from my mail box on XX/XX/XXXX it was again a Notice of Levy ( Enforcement of Judgment ) on my XXXX XXXX  account. The damages against my persona are too much. I will never recover from Identity theft. This collection company make me their slave for life, thanks to the California Laws allow renew them forever. The CashCall contract has the date of XX/XX/XXXX up to day are eleven years, with no signature on the contract.');

( 2 ) The collection agency did not require the assignment as a condition to listing the account, bill, or other evidence of indebtedness with the collection agency for collection.

( 3 ) The assignment was manifested by a written agreement separate from and in addition to any document intended for the purpose of listing the account, bill, or other evidence of indebtedness with the collection agency. The written agreement shall state the effective date of the assignment and the consideration paid or given, if any, for the assignment and shall expressly authorize the collection agency to refer the assigned account, bill, or other evidence of indebtedness to an attorney admitted to the practice of law in this state for the commencement of litigation. The written agreement also shall disclose that the collection agency may consolidate, for purposes of filing an action, the assigned account, bill, or other evidence of indebtedness with those of other creditors against an individual debtor or co-debtors.

( 4 ) Upon the effective date of the assignment to the collection agency, the creditor ''s account maintained by the collection agency in connection with the assigned account, bill, or other evidence of indebtedness was canceled. ( G ) Nothing in this section relieves a collection agency from complying with the " Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, '''' 91 Stat. 874 ( 1977 ), 15 U.S.C. 1692, as amended, or deprives any debtor of the right to assert defenses as provided in section 1317.031 of the Revised Code and 16 C.F.R. 433, as amended.

It is obvious how seriously that this collection company takes this, as they close out my complaints in less than 24hrs without any real investigation.

AGAIN, I NEVER received any bill for this debt from the original creditor-XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX- who is a third party billing company out of Ohio . XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX- based in Ohio , has been found guilty of fraudulent billing in several cases. I have NEVER been a patient at XXXX XXXX XXXX, in XXXX, OK. XXXX  has falsely claimed that XXXX XXXX XXXX is in XXXX , OK, which it is not, it is in XXXX  , OK-this first claim shows that their information is clearly flawed. AGAIN, my credit report shows the information given from XXXX-claims the original creditor ''s service being XXXX  of XX/XX/XXXX. Their claim of me being seen at XXXX XXXX XXXX in late XX/XX/XXXX is not even possible, given the fact that this hospital was torn down in XXXX of XX/XX/XXXX after being struck by a tornado. It was rebuilt and opened in XXXX  of XX/XX/XXXX-reopened as XXXX XXXX XXXX hospital in XXXX, OK.

More importantly, XXXX   has refused to even address repeated request for validation of this debt, they refuse to provide ANY original documents proving what is owed. They are required to send proof that they own this debt or have been legally assigned this debt by the original creditor along with original documentation showing proof of debt.

According to federal law, if a debt collector does not verify the debt, it is not allowed to list the debt on a person ''s credit report.

Also, the State of Oklahoma requires a creditor to provide the following documentation to prove the validity of a debt- proof of service, proof of breach of payment, copy of any contract or original account and documentation of assignment of debt. This information came directly from the Oklahoma Attorney General ''s office, after I submitted copies of all complaints/disputes with XXXX.

XXXX has now refused to comply on multiple occasions and attempted to make me think that I am incorrect and that the burden of proof lies with me, not them.

XXXX is required to show proof of this debt, not pass the buck on to me.

AGAIN, XXXX  has shown zero proof of anything being owed.

XXXX has a well established history of fraudulent activities.

XXXX  refuses to provide any documentation/consumer disclosure file on this debt.');

At that point, I left at least 2 messages notifying them this was my cell phone and not to call that number and that I  filed bankruptcy and all debt was included. I left the attorney ''s information to contact. I also asked for a letter to be mailed regarding the debt as I have never received any notification of the debt. I received nothing that I requested to comply with FDCPA and provide notification of the debt being collected on. This also did not stop the calls. XXXX XXXX continued to call and leave voicemails. Today he called again and I was near my phone and answered the call. He proceeded to tell me that " they '''' ( he still did not provide name of agency ) were going to file garnishment against my pay. He also then made the comment that I am filing bankruptcy every 7 years, just spending money and then filing bankruptcy, which is harassment under FDCPA. On NO message left was the Mini Miranda and each contact was a collection effort. When I told him today the credit card was in my bankruptcy, he stated that it didn''t matter, that the client had requested to file garnishment against me. I advised he needed to contact my attorney and he stated he knew who I was and would just proceed with his client ''s request. He stated that Barclay was not included in my bankruptcy. This was the FIRST time I was notified of who the creditor was. I told him that I knew it was included and he needed to contact attorney. He would not take the attorney information. Instead, he continued to threaten me with garnishment. I told him, if he file anything against me, I would file suit, and he hung up in my face. I will be contacting an attorney to file suit for harassment and several other FDCPA violations. This credit card ( Barclays '' ) was included in my Chapter XXXX bankruptcy and is not owed by me.');

I intended on paying my entire balance in full on my previous statement, which was {$1100.00} and was surprised when I saw my statement was {$2400.00}. Upon calling Synchroncy Bank, the initial representative was extremely unhelpful and I quickly requested to speak with a supervisor. 

The supervisor stated that the new balance reflected interest calculated through the life of loan. The online payment system kept telling me a minimum payment, which I made double, sometimes even quadruple on a monthly basis with the exception of XXXX so that I would have a little extra money to spend for XXXX gifts for my loved ones. The system only reflected the minimum payment expected for the loan without the calculated interested that was building up. The supervisor said that the fees assessed reflects total interest calculated for the life of the loan to this point. 

Additionally, the APR on this credit card is 29.99 % which I was not aware was happening. I was making payments to the best of my ability, even through job loss and under employment with the intention of paying off the entire debt today. 

The balance now, with the APR makes it impossible for me to do so. The supervisor insisted that they could only waive a single fee- the XX/XX/XXXX interest, but could not waive anything else- the life of the loan interest. She also stated that there is no way to settle the debt or modify the terms to make it more reasonable. 

This company is directly violating the FDCPA by making terms unfair, deceptive and abusive. There is no way that this should have happened. Synchrony Bank did attempt to reach out to me via phone call but never once left a message. Their emails to me never once warned me about this promotion ending and started harassing me for missing a single payment even though I had always paid more than the minimum. 

Furthermore, the manager that I spoke with at Synchrony Bank gave me conflicting information about where the corporate headquarters is, stating that they only had a PO box and did not provide a physical location to mail any payments, should I agree to mail a settled payment.');

INSERT INTO complaints(Complaint_ID,Date_received,Product,Subproduct,Issue,Subissue,Consumer_complaint_narrative) VALUES ('3158190','02/20/19','Debt collection','Credit card debt','Attempts to collect debt not owed','Debt was paid','This is regarding the purchase of item on XX/XX/XXXX for {$370.00} at Home Depot using a Home Depot Consumer Credit Card issued and serviced by Citibank, N.A.. 
The day of purchase I was told by a Home Depot associate that the item was on sale and that if I applied for a Home Depot credit card and paid for the item with the new credit card that there would be special financing on the item. I would not have to pay any interest on the item nor pay for the item for 6 months. I specifically asked the associate if I needed to pay anything within the 6 months. The associate replied " No '''', just pay the full amount in 6 months. So I believed that no payment for this one item was required until XX/XX/XXXX. I applied for the credit card and used it to purchase the item as well as one other item. The first bill that I received is attached ( pages 1 thru 3 ). The total amount is for {$400.00} ( {$370.00} for promotional item and {$31.00} for a second item ), it is page 1 of the attachment. Minimum payment was {$27.00}. I sent a check in the amount of {$31.00} to cover the full cost of second item purchased. I did this to ensure that there would be no interest charged on the first purchase. I then ignored all further bills since it was my understanding that no payments were required until XX/XX/XXXX. 
The next time I became aware of this issue was upon receiving a letter from a collection agency - XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX - around XX/XX/XXXX. See page 4 of attachment. I promptly called them and explained that it was my understanding that I did not need to pay the {$370.00} until XX/XX/XXXX. They did not have a copy of the bill, so I faxed them the page and noted that I did not have to pay until XX/XX/XXXX. In the interim I paid the {$370.00} for the item ( shown on page 5 of attachment ) before the XX/XX/XXXX due date. 
I contacted XXXX XXXX again on XX/XX/XXXX. They said that my dispute was rejected and that I would have to pay all fees and interest charges. They told me I should have read the fine print. If I had to read and understand every fine print on every transaction that I make, I probably would not buy anything. I wonder how many sales associates would be able to explain the fine print to me? 
Well I did read the bill and fine print. This is what I found : A ) In the middle of the first page ( 1st page of attachment ) of the bill it reads " You must pay your promotional balance of {$370.00} in full by XX/XX/XXXX to avoid paying deferred interest charges. ". So I thought that the only payment I needed to make was this amount in XX/XX/XXXX. 
B ) In upper righthand corner of second page of bill ( 2nd page of  attachment ) under heading " How to Avoid Interest on Purchases '''' second paragraph it states " If you have a balance subject to a deferred interest or 0 % APR promotion and that promotion does not expire before the payment due date, that balance ( the " excluded balance '''' ) is excluded from the amount you must pay in full to get a grace period ''''. Again it seems to me that I needed to pay the amount before XX/XX/XXXX. 
C ) On the third page ( 3rd page of attachment ) of the bill under " TRANSACTIONS '''' it states " PROMOTIONAL PURCHASE : To avoid interest charges, please pay the above in full by XX/XX/XXXX. Monthly payments required. ". I just noticed this as I was creating this dispute. Still not clear what monthly payments mean as it relates to this transaction. 
D ) On the third page ( 3rd page of attachment ) of the bill under " ACTIVITY AND PROMTIONS DETAIL '''' there is a column headed " Promotion Minimum Payment Due ''''. The amount shown is {$0.00}. Again I have to believe that the only payment that I have to make is for the full amount in XX/XX/XXXX. 

This entire bill for this transaction is confusing to me. I am XXXX years young. I have made many transactions in my life time. Many more complex than buying one item at Home Depot with a Home Depot charge card. I have never had an issue such as this or a more confusing transaction. If I had known that I had to make monthly payments, I would have paid the entire bill at once ( not a huge purchase ). I am requesting a waiver of all interest charges and fees ( {$140.00} shown on page 5 of attachment ).');

I was shocked to see accounts that I do not recognize, including companies I''ve never done business with. One of these was : PUGET SOUND COLLECT. The address LISTED ON the credit report is : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, WA XXXX. I was advised by an attorney to send a " Validation '''' Letter to them to validate the debt under the FDCPA and FCRA. It has been 60 days since I mailed that out, and under the FDCPA, the debt collector had 30 days to respond, and did not, which is a violation of the FCRA and FDCPA. Please note that before sending the validation letter to this company, I also sent a dispute letter to all 3 credit bureaus ( XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX ) and PUGET SOUND COLLECT has NOT removed this account from my credit reports, or have sent me any kind of validation. I request for this company to remove this account from my credit reports immediately, as they have not followed the law, have reported inaccurate information on my credit reports, including FDCPA Section 809 ( b ), which carries a {$1000.00} fine for not validating the debt and still continuing to report it on my credit reports. In addition to this, they''re reporting that they originally purchased this collection on XX/XX/2013. The statute of limitations starts when a debt FIRST becomes delinquent. Even if the first delinquency of this erroneous debt with the original creditor was on the SAME date that this debt collector purchased the debt, there would only be 9 months left in the statute of limitations. Title 4, Chapter 16 of the Revised Code of Washington ( RCW ) outlines the various statutes of limitations for debt collection in the state. RCW 4.16.040 gives written contracts and accounts receivable a statute of limitations of 6 years before the unpaid debt becomes time-barred. RCW 4.16.080 stipulates that oral contracts have a statute of limitations of 3 years. Thank you for helping me resolve this matter.');

I told ProCollect I didn''t agree with the charges and they told me to fax them a letter of denial/appeal, which I did. I faxed this letter of appeal on XX/XX/XXXX. I called to check on the status of my appeal and was told by Ms. XXXX at extension XXXX that she didn''t see my letter in the system yet but not to worry as it takes time to get put into their system for the collection agents to see that. She said they would call me back. Next call I get from Pro-Collect was from an agent that knew nothing of my appeal letter and didn''t seem to be interested in looking for it so I asked to be transferred to Ms XXXX but was hung up on instead. I tried calling back but was rudely put on hold till I finally hung up as i had no more time that day to hold. The very next day I get an alert from XXXX XXXX that a collection was put on my credit. This company denied me my right to appeal this debt before damaging my credit. I am a good steward of my credit, and this is the only blemish I have and it was put there in denial of my rights. I am outraged that these companies are allowed to operate as if they make the laws, and people have no rights. I am sure that my rights have been violated. My appeal was never heard before damaging my credit for the next 7 year of my life. I can provide the appeal letter sent to them as well as proof of fax that I received showing it went through to them. As I am writing this, Pro Collect called again and care nothing of the fact that I sent them a letter of appeal. They are like robots that read a script and threaten you without actually listening to anything you say. Shame on these people, and shame on a system that allows people to be treated so poorly. I have excellent credit and have never defaulted on anything in my life. These collection calls are new to me, and I am now realizing how people are treated as if they have no rights. This is barbaric and has got to stop.');

I informed them I couldn''t pay the full amount due to having XXXX, but I could pay the majority. The rep said that would be fine and she would contact me in XXXX to set up new payment arrangements. In XXXX I was contacted by another representative asking about payment. I attempted to remit the payment by phone, but was told it could not be accepted. A week later, I received another call and spoke with a different representative who advised me {$50.00} was not good enough, and he needed the full amount owed on the account. I advised him I could only pay {$50.00} right now, and he declined to take the payment, again stating he needed the full account balance, and until I paid that he would continue calling and take other measures up to and including court. Since then, they have called nearly everyday and have been given the same information with the same response. They are also calling my friends and family saying my phone is disconnected and they are seeking me to sue for the remaining balance. Today, XX/XX/XXXX I received a call from the regional supervisor. I advised her of the previous conversation, and she said there were no notes and the account notes reflected they had not heard from me since XXXX. This is a false statement since I have been paying monthly throughout XXXX. I informed her of the refused payments, in which she stated there were no notes. She consistently talked over me, not allowing me to speak saying, " If you had paid the full amount, we wouldn''t be calling. '''' She asked me twice to stop cursing at her, and not once had I used any foul language. She then said she was hanging up on me, due to my language and again, not one time had I used foul language. In fact, I was hardly allowed to speak without her speaking over me. In the past, this company has been harassing in nature to the point of having to file a formal complaint with the local court, due to an employee threatening to have me thrown in jail and my kids put into fostercare.');

I called XXXX, and explained the situation to the agent. The agent okayed my early contract termination, waived the termination fee, and provided me with my final amount due. I paid the final amount, and the agent verified I didn''t owe anything further, and closed my account. 

XXXX : I get a letter in the mail from XXXX XXXX, letting me know they were attempting to collect a debt for XXXX, stating I owed them {$380.00}. Confused, I called XXXX and asked them why I owed them. The agent couldn''t tell me because my " account was sold ''''. I asked why XXXX never contacted me to let me know. They claim they did, but I was XXXX, so I wouldn''t know. My wife saved all mail, unopened, addressed to me, with the exception of any utility/service bills that we shared that had to be opened to be paid, and none were from XXXX, but one was from XXXX XXXX. She never recalled seeing anything from XXXX. I then called XXXX XXXX and inquired about this supposed debt.

I then informed XXXX that the debt was not valid, as I am XXXX XXXX, and had exercised my benefits under the SCRA, and I would be sending them a Debt Validation/Verification/Cease and Desist ( unless to validate/verify the debt, via letter ). I sent the letter via certified mail, and waited, and waited for verification/validation of that debt. 

Free yearly credit report time rolls around, and I hop on to each of the credit bureaus, and to my didmay, for the first time ever, there are negative remarks/reports. From XXXX XXXX. I open up a dispute with each bureau, stating that it had been over SIX months since I had sent a validation/verification letter, via certified mail, to XXXX XXXX, and I had yet to receive a response. I also mentioned that the original debt was not owed, as I was afforded benefits under the SCRA, which I exercised, and that the original creditor ( XXXX ) assured me that I was fully paid up when they closed my account. When I received replies from each credit bureau, they were all in agreement with me, and the negative remarks/reports were removed from each of my credit reports. 

XX/XX/XXXX : I receive a piece of mail from XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX. OH. MY. GOD! This company is attempting to collect a debt of {$380.00} for my " current creditor '''', XXXX XXXX, who is trying to collect a debt for my " original creditor '''', XXXX. I send a Debt Validation/Verification/Cease and Desist ( unless to validate/verify debt via LETTER ), notice of past Statute of Limitations, and also bring up the fact that I was XXXX XXXX at the time, and still am XXXX XXXX, and was, and am, exercising my SCRA benefits. 

XX/XX/XXXX : ARE YOU XXXX KIDDING ME?!! I receive a letter, this time from XXXX XXXX, XXXX, stating that I have a debt of {$380.00}, owed to my " current creditor '''', XXXX XXXX. This letter also states that " XXXX XXXX can not sue you or report on your credit fot this debt. '''' They go on to say that I have to notify them within 30 days that I dispute the validity of the debt, or they will assume it''s valid. 

HOLD UP! So, I send XXXX the first debt validation letter, so THEY KNOW I am seeking validity/verification of the debt, but even after TEN YEARS, they have YET to send me any such letter. Even so, they SELL this debt to one company ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX  ) ; I send another validation/verification letter to THAT company, and then XXXX SELLS THE DEBT AGAIN, this time to XXXX XXXX, XXXX? What the XXXX? 

So, I have yet ANOTHER validation/verification letter I have to send, via certified mail, AT MY COST. It will be sent today, Monday, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX. 

If it''s NOT illegal to sell debtspast the SOL, it SHOULD be.

If it''s NOT illegal for a company to just keep reselling debt past the SOL, instead of sending validation/verification, when a LETTER REQUESTING IT HAS BEEN SENT, it SHOULD be.

If it''s NOT illegal to keep pursuing a debt past the SOL, even though you KNOW the debt is being disputed because it was acquired in a manner that violates any law or act, including the SCRA, it SHOULD be. 

Not only do I feel harrassed by XXXX XXXX, I hold a XXXX XXXX, and even though I can easily explain this DEBT I DO NOT OWE, it still looks unprofessional.');

I disputed it and asked for validation. 

On CCS ''s letter to me dated XX/XX/XXXX they sent the attached XXXX XXXX statement saying I did not pay for the insurance from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. 

This is a false statement because my insurance account did not extend to the period they are trying to collect. My insurance with them was from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. The policy ended on XX/XX/XXXX and I did not renew the policy with them. So the alleged {$250.00} they are trying to collect in not mine. ( see attached XX/XX/XXXX). 

XXXX XXXX ''s statement that " the payment I made was not enough to completely cover the time insured XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX '''', is a false and untrue statement because I did not renew the policy for that period and therefore was not insured by them within that alleged time. And I did not make any payment within the alleged time from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. 

I did not approve the changes they had to renew the police and decided not to make the payment that would have been the means of acceptance as per their request. 

I did not renew the policy and therefore I did not have to pay them for service they did not provide. And I am not obligated to tell them who I insures with. 

CCS reporting false and inaccurate information on my credit record is in violation of the XXXX XXXX XXXX, FCRA and FDCPA.

They made an offer for our Cable and Internet Service that would save us over {$100.00} per month. We went ahead with this plan and called our former cable company, XXXX XXXX, and they said to return all of their equipment to cancel our service with them. We did so on XX/XX/XXXX and we asked them if we owed anything on our account and were told they did not know but they would contact us if we did. We never received an e-mail nor any billing in the mail from them so we assumed we did not owe anything and forgot about it all. 

Then in the last week of XXXX we received a letter not from XXXX  XXXX but from a Debt Collection company, Credit Management LP, stating we owed {$160.00} to XXXX  XXXX. From this, we knew this would affect my husband ''s credit report and we had never received a previous billing via mail or our e-mail prior to receiving the letter from the Debt Collection Company. 

Our son immediately got on the phone and called XXXX XXXX and asked them why this amount owed was sent to a collection agency when a ) we had never received a bill prior to this notice and b ) that the account was sent to a third party collection company in less than 2 months of our cancelling our service. 

The representative on the phone stated they had mailed two billings but we never received them and had been actively looking for any notification about an amount still owed. If we had known that this amount was due soon after we closed our account, we would have reviewed it and taken care of it but now it has been sent to collections and we both want to ensure this is not reflective on my husband ''s credit report prior to our paying it and want to know why we were never notified of this debt before it was sent to a Third Party Collection. 

My son has suggested that this is in retaliation for our canceling our service and I am unsure if this is the reason but what I do know is if we had owed anything, then we should have received a billing in the mail and/or been contacted by XXXX XXXX before it was sent to collection and we also want to inquire as to why it was sent to collection in less than 60 days of our closing our account.');

I called RP, and asked them why since I did send two payments. In the midst of the conversation, the Supervisor XXXX explained that I was late and changed payments. I told him that I only changed one payment and that was for XX/XX/XXXX. However, I found out that Receivables Performance is not licensed in the state of North Carolina to ask for me to pay them this debt. I spoke with them about this, and each time they will hang up. The last conversation I had with a supervisor, she lied on the phone about me calling and having a conversation with them on XX/XX/XXXX and eventually she hung up as well. Because this collection agency is not licensed to collect a debt for the state of North Carolina, I believe that they should delete and remove this derogatory remark off my credit.');

I have NEVER had an account with XXXX XXXX or XXXX, and I notified ERC, but they won''t take it off my credit report and continue sending me letters. 

I had an account with XXXX XXXX XXXX for my business, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I was talking to a woman from their Corporate Office, and she talked me into having a phone. She said the technician would be out to hook it up. No technician ever came out. I never went online due to worrying about breaking confidentiality, and I just starting going online about a year and a half ago while attending XXXX College. Anyway I switched to XXXX because I needed a phone. Once I finally had a phone line ( through XXXX  ), I called the Corporate Office of XXXX, and I explained my situation ( that a woman said a technician would be out to connect the telephone, but no one came out ). A man on the phone told me that they never turned on the phone in the office ( I had the impression the way he spoke that they never turned on a switch, but I''m not sure how they turn on phones ), but i knew no technician ever came out. I explained to the man that I was upset because I received a bill and was going to contact a lawyer because I had to reprint all of my letterhead, business cards, advertising with pens that had my business information on it, essentially everything that had my business information on it. I was irate because three weeks without a phone can kill a business, and it basically killed mine because no one could find me. The man on the phone assured me that my account would be taken care of and I owe nothing. I never heard anything about this debt until about six months ago. 

I am assuming that XXXX XXXX XXXX was bought out by XXXX XXXX because that is who ERC says I owe, but I never had an account with XXXX  XXXX. XXXX XXXX must of been bought by XXXX   because I had a letter from ERC stating I owe XXXX  {$170.00}. I have never had an account with XXXX. I did have a lady come by asking if I wanted cable through XXXX, and I thought it was interesting that she said I did not have to pay a deposit ( which if I truly owed XXXX  they would of asked for a deposit ). I was going to get cable through XXXX, but I called and spoke to a gentleman ( who I believe was in the Corporate Office, or may be Collections ), and he notified me that I do owe them {$170.00} and I have to pay it because they will not forgive this, even though I explained my situation and was told my balance was XXXX when I spoke to XXXX. 

My account for XXXX XXXX XXXX was XXXX XXXX dba XXXX '' XXXX XXXX XXXX. If I felt I owed this debt, I would pay it, but I do not feel that I owe it. The phone was never turned on, and no technician ever came out to my address. XXXX cost me a lot of money when they never turned on the phone and people couldn''t find me if they needed me. I was going to hire a lawyer at that time, and now I wish I would have because the matter would of been settled! I told the man from the Corporate Office that I was going to hire a lawyer, and he said he was sorry for all of my trouble and he satisfied my debt, and I owe nothing. 

I do not want each time the account is sold to another company that I will owe this debt. It has been in three different company names now, but I only had an account with XXXX. Please investigate this to the fullest! There is no account with my name dba XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX '' or XXXX  '' names. I switched to XXXX  when XXXX never connected my phone, and I am still with them today! Please investigate because if it is sold to another company, that new company is going to say I owe them when I truly do not! I don''t know if the XXXX Corporate Office knew they were being bought and just told me that to pacify me, but I never heard anything about it until years later by different companies. I wish I would of gotten a lawyer like I wanted to when I switched to XXXX  because it did cost me a lot of time and money having to change everything, not to mention the stress of not having a working phone but having bills of a business ( which is a lot more expensive than residential-personal bills ) and no client can find me because I had no phone. Please investigate? Any questions, please contact me at ( XXXX ) XXXX.

Both calls were ignored because I was at work! So instead of leaving a message and waiting for a call back. The third time they decided to call me AT WORK and have this hour long chit chat. 
I explained to them that I did not have the money or the means to pay them and the women I talked to was very cooperative in trying to find a solution. Even going so far as to ask my what bills I pay monthly to figure a cost that I could pay on a payment plan. ( Where she grossly overestimated about {$300.00} ) and still I explained that I would have to talk to my exroommate who was also on the lease, where we were co-signed, and so we share the responsibility on the remaining debt. According to XXXX, about XXXX , on a bill I have already paid {$740.00} to, paid to the original apartment. 
Then they spoke to my exroommate ( who works in the same building I do ) and the woman we spoke to came up with a plan for her, my exroommate, to pay off the rest. 
They told her that if she paid {$100.00} that they could extend the payment to be due near the end of XXXX. In which time the exroommate was to get a loan to pay off the remaining balance. ( She has already applied and been approved for the loan and paid the money for the date extension ) Fast forward to today Friday, XX/XX/XXXX. Where once again I get a phone call on ym personal from XXXX. This time with a voicemail attached about the collection. 
I call them back on my break, because I for one, am confused. I thought the debt and the date had already been hashed out and don''t understand why I''m receiving YET ANOTHER CALL. About something that already had a plan of action. 
This is where I talked with one of XXXX  associates, XXXX. Who must have lost her XXXX MIND. 
XXXX was set off by me chuckling. Yes how dare I laugh at her and the absurdity of the situation. 
She proceeds to tell me ( all of these conversations remember can be replayed and called back to because they record for ''quality '' ) That exroommate has made a payment of about {$600.00} but the rest has been denied.

So why are you calling me I ask?

Because your name is on the collection so you are responsible for the remanding balance due she replies.

Yes. I understand that. But a payment has already been made. Almost {$600.00} you just told me. But I can''t tell you why the rest has been denied or any type of personal info on the exroommates account. You should probably get ahold of her. 
XXXX from XXXX did not like that answer. Continued to be hostile. Obtuse. And all together extremely unhelpful. And more and more personally offended that I was not giving her the information that she wanted. Or offering to pay up another XXXX ON THE SPOT. All while I''m still at work you recall. Instead of trying and waiting again to get ahold of the exroommate. 
Then she transfers me to a ''supervisor '' XXXX XXXX , who clearly will not have her job for very long. She was repulsive to have to have dealt with. Went STRAIGHT to yelling. Being defensive, aggressive, threatening and outright calling ME a liar. 
She changed her story multiple times. Gave me no clear answer on how much money they actually already collected ( from my exroommates bank account without permission ) refused to send me to someone less hostile who could actually help me. And then the two of them gave me the run-around like my future credit was some game to them. They clearly can not be held to any type of standard if that''s how they are training their supervisors to behave.

So I decided to get in touch with my exroommate seeing as how the two children I was dealing with could not make the effort to talk to the person THEY ALREADY HAD AN AGREED UPON PAYMENT SYSTEM SET UP. 
She informed me then, that they had already came up with the earlier mentioned setup ( where she pays {$100.00} for good faith and until her loan came in. And by the end of XXXX she had a chance to pay. Again while she waits for the loan SHE WAS ALREADY ACCEPTED FOR ) SHE also informed me that XXXX   had already taken a payment from her. ALMOST {$800.00}!!! 
AND WHEN she tried to call to talk to the person who we had talked to previously, back on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX and XXXX XXXX gave her the same hostility, threats and runaround of not having a person who works there capable of doing their job. 
I won''t be marked down as ''refusal to pay '' when they have already dipped their nasty little fingers into someone else ''s bank account. And they are running around lying about how much money is actually owed. I need an adult who can verify the payment plan WE first were agreed upon. 

It must also be noted, that XXXX has never made any attempt to send a first bill to begin with. Simply went straight to the harassing phone calls at work.');

USPS.com tracking shows that it was delivered on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX. I have also attached a copy of the " Certified Mail Receipt '''' so that you can see the tracking of this letter. 

Under the law, they had 30 days after receiving the validation letter to respond to my letter and validate the debt that they''re reporting to the credit bureaus. It has been 53 days ( Today is XX/XX/XXXX ) and they have not sent me anything at all. I have given well over the 30 day window for them to correct this and validate this debt they''re reporting, but they have not done so. 

Please note that before sending the validation letter to this company, I also sent a dispute letter to all 3 credit bureaus ( XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX ) and Sunrise Credit Services have NOT removed this account from my credit reports, or have sent me any kind of validation. 

I request for this company to remove this account from my credit reports immediately, as they have not followed the law, including FDCPA Section 809 ( b ), which carries a {$1000.00} fine for not validating the debt and still continuing to report it on my credit reports.

I want to be truthful right from the beginning so you can understand my problem. It''s not that I never had an account with XXXX. It''s not even that i didn''t owe them money. The problem is that I don''t owe anywhere near what they are attempting to collect from me. They are attempting to collect almost triple what I owed. I have had a problem with it for years and now I''ve had it. Well I finally have proof that they are attempting to extort and racketeer an illegal amount and I will no longer stand for it. 

Back In XXXX I went to purchase a home with XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX  pulled a credit report and I saw there was accounts that never belonged to me. Because there were so many, I assumed this was a identity theft case and filled out a notarized ID theft affidavit along with a police report. I submitted the fraud packet to all the credit bureaus so that the accounts that did not belong to me would get removed. It mostly worked. All the accounts on my credit report that were fraudulent were deleted from my report and an extended security alert was placed on my credit report. The only account that did not get deleted was the ERC collection for XXXX. 

I received a letter from ERC dated XX/XX/XXXX. In that letter, I received an itemization from XXXX showing a total balance of {$1400.00} for a bill of XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX and a bill date of XX/XX/XXXX. It had a XXXX account number which you have asked me not to place on this complaint. I''m sure ERC thought this account was now valid as they had handed me a detailed itemization with my name, address, account number, and balance due. What i''m sure they didn''t expect is that this account ledger was proof that XXXX has been racketeering charges illegally and I am now close to filing a lawsuit against XXXX and ERC as a result. I hope they don''t take this threat idly because I am dead serious. To show you, ERC, and XXXX that I am serious, I will provide you with the same document I provided to ERC on my complaint to them via e-mail on XXXX. 

I happen to have a collection notice from a collection agency named XXXX  XXXX. It is for a XXXX collection for the amount of {$520.00}. It has the exact same account number as the XXXX itemization of XX/XX/XXXX. Here is the kicker however. The collection notice for XXXX XXXX is for a date of XX/XX/XXXX ... Not to sound insulting, but let that sink in for a moment. Just in case however, I will describe the situation in detail. 

ERC is attempting to collect an account for XXXX with a final billing cycle of XX/XX/XXXX for {$1400.00} +. The problem is that the same XXXX account was closed off and sent to collection back in XX/XX/XXXX for only {$520.00} ... How can an account that was already closed and sent to collection in XX/XX/XXXX still be racking up charges until XX/XX/XXXX? If that doesn''t prove the charges on this account are erroneous and fraudulent then I don''t know what does. But it gets even worse from here. 

Since I didn''t seem to be having any luck, and ERC was supposedly being verified at the credit bureau level, I decided to hire an old friend of mine to help me in fighting this. he called ERC on XX/XX/XXXX explaining the situation. he spoke with a collector named XXXX XXXX. In that conversation, he was transferred to a team lead named XXXX. XXXX asked that he submit an e-mail with the proof I had about the fraudulent account. he did so on XX/XX/XXXX with a full explanation as well as the requested documents. In that e-mail he was very specific in that I was demanding that they deem this account as fraudulent and cancel the account back to XXXX. He even warned them of the impending complaints I would be filing and the lawsuits I would be bringing up should they fail to comply. Well guess what? They didn''t comply. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, my friend called ERC because we noticed the account was still on my credit report. He spoke with an XXXX XXXX. XXXX told him that they did in fact receive our documents but that the account was never placed under fraud nor was XXXX ever contacted. In the e-mail I will provide you a copy of, you will note that the first sentence in the second paragraph mentions this account as being disputed as fraud. Why would they not place this account as fraud? Why would they simply place this account as a disputed account wen they were given evidence that the itemization they provided was faulty and erroneous? I''ll tell you why. because ERC does not care about the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. They are simply attempting to feign ignorance by claiming they don''t have any power to change anything. My friend asked to speak to a supervisor and was able to do so but I don''t have his name. That conversation pretty much went the same way. They aren''t going to do anything but ask their client if this is a fraudulent account ... 

I had to read the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act because this account has been preventing me from buying a home since XXXX. I learned that under 809. Validation of Debts, if I dispute a debt, they have 30 days to provide proof that the debt is valid or cease collecting the debt. Well when ERC received the dispute on XX/XX/XXXX, they had until XX/XX/XXXX to fix this account or get proof. They never did. In fact, XXXX and the supervisor stated they would begin their investigation with XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX ... well past the 30 day mark. They were just THEN beginning the investigation. I won''t stand for it. I am filing this complaint not just for me but so you can look into their practices and operations as I am sure I am not the only person they are trying to take advantage of.');

It was found during my mortgage application process. The mortgage company gave me the contact information for the company and advised me what to ask for. I spoke to an initial agent who was very rude. She confirmed that the phone number that they were calling was my old home number which we do not use anymore. I advised her of that information. She then gave me my husbands cell phone number which I advised was a cell phone and that they didnt have permission to call. Before I could tell her that he had not received any calls, she stated " you received care in the emergency room so you need to pay your debt. '''' I asked her the amount and was given {$64.00} and {$150.00}. I told her I would be happy to pay it as long as I got a letter stating what hospital it was, the amount, that it was paid in full and that they would remove it from my credit report. She then told me they don''t do that and that I cant pay to clean up my credit.I advised her at that time she didnt have to be rude and that I wanted a supervisor or manager. She then told me that her supervisor would tell me the same thing. I said thats fine and I would be happy to pay, but I needed that letter. She then transferred me to a lady who identified herself as XXXX. She was aggressive from the time she got on the line. She repeated the same thing the other agent did. I then stated that since they would not help me obtain a letter on the debt and remove it from my credit report I would call XXXX Hospital directly. XXXX then told me that they were employees of XXXX Hospital and that they do not outsource their collections department. I knew that was false as I lived in GA and the company was in Florida. I let her know that I would be calling the hospital directly and ended the call. I called XXXX Hospital and spoke to a lady named XXXX. I explained to her what had happened and what I needed. She advised me that XXXX and the other lady I had spoken to were not employees of XXXX and that she would notify her manager of their rude behavior and false statement. XXXX provided me with a receipt and said I would also receive a detailed statement that the balance was {$0.00}. She also stated that they would contact the company to let them know to remove my information from their files and that the accounts were paid in full and that they should remove it from my credit reports. XXXX also advised me to dispute the item with the credit bureaus as well. This company should not be making false statements as to who they are and what company they work for.');

Mediation for this matter will be at the XXXX County Courthouse in XXXX, Colorado, on Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX, at XXXX XXXX. 
I found the Consent Order online while researching in preparation for my case and discovered that RCS Recovery Services had not complied with numerous provisions by which they were bound in perpetuity. 
1. I am judgement proof. My only income is from VA XXXX and Social Security. I own no property. 
2. I have stated this repeatedly, yet they continue to hound me with this lawsuit. I am XXXX years old, retired, and a XXXX veteran. I believe their intent has been to wear me down and hope that I not show up or fight them, as your Consent Order details. 
3. Their documentation is faulty and confusing, lacking dates, my name, and does not demonstrate standing. 
4. This lawsuit is well past the Statutes of Limitations timeline for Colorado, 6 years. They tried to ameliorate this by stating that if the original financial institution accelerated the loan, they rescind the acceleration. They have yet to answer their own question, nor have provided documentation, about acceleration. 
5. RCS Recovery Services has violated this mandate : IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent, Respondent ''s  officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys, and all other persons in active concert or participation with any of them, who receive actual notice of this Consent Order, whether acting directly or indirectly, are permanently restrained and prohibited from : 125. Collecting or attempting to collect any Time-Barred Debt through litigation or arbitration. 
6. They did not include this information in any of their collection correspondence with me : Respondent will include the following statement : " For those Time-Barred Debts that generally can not be included in a consumer report under the provisions of the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. 1681c ( a ), but can be collected through other means pursuant to applicable state law, Respondent will include the following statement : " The law limits how long you can be sued on a debt and how long a debt can appear on your credit report. Due to the age of this debt, we will not sue you for it or report payment or non-payment of it to a credit bureau ; '''' and The law limits how long you can be sued on a debt. 
Because of the age of your debt, we will not sue you for it. " 7.  They provided no original account-level documentation of the foreclosure. 
8. They did not state the amount for which they purchased the loan. 
9. XXXX XXXX appears to have also purchased the loan, but the documentation RCS Recovery Services provided is undated and contains no dollar amount. The confusing few mentions of XXXX XXXX does not make it clear if they bought the loan from, or sold the loan to, RCS Recovery Services.

10. The law firm representing RCS Recovery Services, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, has five lawyers, fitting the description by the CFPB Consent Order of their employing small firms all over the country. 
11. I do not have the money to employ a lawyer and have been representing myself throughout. I believe I will prevail because of my tenacity, research, and belief that I do not owe RCS Recovery Services a dime. However, this has taken a toll on my health. I XXXX   more than ever and have been XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in the past few weeks in anticipation of mediation and the trial. I had my XXXX XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX, involving all of my XXXX and most of my XXXX XXXX. Beginning about a year prior, I was in XXXX XXXX XXXX, with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The recovery is ongoing. I expressed this to the Plaintiff, and I believe they have exploited my weakness during this period. I am seeing both a XXXX and a XXXX   at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Hospital in XXXX, Colorado, and have discussed this issue at every visit. 
12. Mediation was XX/XX/XXXX between attorney XXXX XXXX of the XXXX XXXX XXXX and myself. I stated my position that they did not have standing, the case was well beyond Statutes of Limitation, I am judgement proof, their documentation was fatally flawed, I will not pay them a dime, and invoked XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( they inflicted their injuries on themselves by purchasing a debt that was beyond the Statutes of Limitations. ) 13. XXXX tried relentlessly to intimidate and shame me. She pretended not to know about the CFPB Consent Order. She tried to get me to enter into a judgement without going to court. She said that she had been before this judge many times and that he never ruled for the defendant with defenses such as mine. 
14. I ceased participation and mediation was concluded. 
15. The pre-trial conference will be in two weeks, followed by the trial on XX/XX/XXXX. I will contact you with updates and documentation. 
16. I will forward current documentation as soon as I have it organized and scanned.');

XXXX, XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX, reported a collection account to all three of my major credit bureaus on behalf of a healthcare service provider ( XXXX XXXX/XXXX-XXXX XXXX ) for the amount of {$2400.00} with an accruing interest rate of 10 % in demand to collect on a settled medical lien that was paid in full and as agreed nearly 4 years ago as part of a litigation settlement in a personal injury lawsuit. The original principle lien balance with XXXX XXXX ( {$1500.00} ) was negotiated down to a final settlement amount of {$410.00} by my attorney ( XXXX XXXX ). Prompt payment for this balance was remitted by check ( no. XXXX ) from my attorney ''s office to XXXX XXXX/XXXX-XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. Bank records of the canceled instrument indicate that the check was presented and collected-on by XXXX-XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. At no point within the intervening 4 years since the account was paid and settled did XXXX XXXX/XXXX-XXXX XXXX  or the furnisher ( Continental Credit Control ) attempt to contact me directly or notify me of the claim for a balanced owed before suddenly reporting a collection to my credit bureaus in XXXX. Upon notice of this collection account ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX ), I took immediate action to contact the furnisher to submit documentation showing that this account was paid as agreed and has been settled since XXXX ( including copies of the canceled instrument from my attorneys escrow account referencing the lien settlement at XXXX XXXX as well as a settlement agreement signed by both the management at XXXX XXXX/XXXX-XXXX XXXX  and my counsel, which I have also attached to this complaint ) ; however, repeated attempts to provide this documentation and to remedy the issue have gone on rebuffed, disregarded, and dismissed by the furnisher. The refusal by Continental Credit Control to receive the documentation demonstrating that this account has been paid as agreed and settled since XXXX and correct the invalid reporting on my credit bureaus accordingly represents willful violation of their obligations under the Fair Credit Reporting Act and a blatant and fraudulent attempt to extort me for a balance not owed. Concomitantly, during the time since XXXX when the invalid collection account was first reported to my credit bureaus, I have repeatedly disputed the collection record with all three major credit reporting agencies ( XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX  ) to no avail. Despite the settlement documentation ( referenced above ) which Ive submitted with each dispute, the credit reporting agencies allege to have verified that the information provided to them by the furnisher is valid and accurate ( cf. XXXX  Report No. XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ; XXXX Confirmation No. XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ; XXXX  # XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ). Thus, even with documentation demonstrating that I have no liability or obligation for this collection account and that this collection account in invalid, the credit reporting agencies have remained unresponsive and unwilling to remedy or correct the error and expunge this invalid collection account along with all derogatory remarks pertaining thereto from my credit bureaus. This also represents willful violation of their obligations under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. As a direct result of the respective failure at the credit reporting agencies to fairly revue my disputes and remedy this issue as well as the ongoing invalid derogatory remarks that continue to be posted to my credit bureaus by the furnisher, my credit score has suffered tremendous and unwarranted damage and continues to decrease. This issue has caused creditors to withdraw offers of credit and/or close good-standing credit accounts as well as other personal and financial damages. Moreover, the negative effects of this invalid collection on my credit bureaus hold serious long-term personal and professional ramifications for me if the issue remains uncorrected.');

I expressed interest in joining the facility. The attendant at the front desk employee took my information and gave me small membership card to join. I selected the $ XXXXmonth fee package to use the facility. I was informed that this is a month to month membership and I can cancel anytime. The front desk also offered me a free training session on that day. After the free training session, the trainer offered me to purchase more training session. With the suggestion of the trainer, I agreed to purchase 4 sessions for {$130.00} on the same day XX/XX/XXXX. On the following month on XX/XX/XXXX, I saw another charge of {$130.00} in my credit card for another 4 more training sessions. In total, I have paid for 8 training sessions. While 1 paid training session remaining unused, I informed the assistant manager of the facility on XX/XX/XXXX that I will not be using the facility anymore. Even after informing the facility, their system kept billing me and kept adding training sessions that I did not ask for and never used. Surprisingly, I received numerous calls from a collection agency on the week of XX/XX/XXXX. When I spoke with the agency on XX/XX/XXXX, the agency told me I owe money XXXX XXXX. After learning about this, I contacted XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke with the club Manager XXXX XXXX. While speaking with XXXX he informed me of a contract which I was uninformed of. After several requests, on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX provided me a copy of that said contract which doesnt have my signature. Since XX/XX/XXXX, I have also requested copy of my usage and billing history which I did not receive. 

XXXX XXXX did not provide me with a copy of that said contract before XX/XX/XXXX. 

Without providing me a valid contract, the company kept adding charges for services that I had never asked for and I had never used. 

Without contacting me directly, XXXX XXXX, shared my information with a third party collection agency. 

The collection agency threatened to report me to credit bureaus and damage my perfect credit history. 

XXXX XXXX owes me a refund for the 1 session that I couldnt use due to scheduling conflict with the trainer. 

XXXX XXXX and its 3rd party collection agency is demanding payment for something I had never asked for and I had never used. 


The facts : 1 ) I had not received these contract from XXXX XXXX  directly from the time time I had started using the facility and to the period I had stopped using the facility. 

2 ) the signatures on the papers are not my signatures.

3 ) these charges were recurring training fees charges which I had never asked for and never used?

4 ) Neither XXXX XXXX not the collection agency provided me usage history even after multiple requests. Even before I had notified the front desk that I will no longer use the facility, I was charged for sessions for which sessions were not provided due to schedule conflict with the trainer. XXXX actually owes me money for those sessions that was not provided. 

4 ) If I want take this matter to the court, which court will have jurisdictions over this matter? I think the state AGs Office regulates the fitness clubs. But in case of I demand a trial, which court should I go to? Would you represent me in this case? 


No one reviewed the terms and no such phone call. Also they didnt give me copy of a contract. After I received call from collection agency, I called the facility and I told them that I was not aware of any agreement. Then the club manager XXXX told me that XXXX XXXX sent me copy of contract at my email at XXXX. But my email is XXXX. So XXXX thought they gave me contract even though they were sending it to the wrong address. 


XXXX  Calls me and emails me saying that XXXX will turn over this account to collection agency. How can XXXX do it when In fact XXXX already turned this over to collection agency before? I became aware of this balance from the collection agency.');

I was being oppressed. She intentionally caused me to have XXXX and I begged her to stop. I stayed professional throughout this while grueling experience. Her exact words were, " I''ll give you the information you need once you answer my questions. '''' I eventually told her that I was disconnecting the call and did so. I then sent an email to the corporate office that same evening and copied the compliance officer. I requested a call back and received no call. The following week, I sent a formal complaint to their office from their website. I still have not received a phone call back. Their email address is XXXX and the compliance officer is XXXX. 
I do know some about the FDCPA and know that a collector should not intentionally cause harm and anxiety to a debtor. This was intentional. Asking the same inappropriate question over and over again- many times-and continuing to do so even after they were told they were causing me unneeded stress.');

This caused an argument between the two of us in which I had to disclose XXXX I had suffered and that is why I went to XXXX. I did reach out to the collection agency and informed them the bill amount was incorrect because I never took a XXXX test. Sh stated it is standard for hospitals to give one. I informed her I am XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX since XX/XX/XXXX therefore the doctor would not have done so. I asked if she could contact XXXX and get the amount of the XXXX test removed because XXXX will not speak with me due to the debt being purchased by California Business Bureau. I even stated I a willing to pay the entire amount due if they can remove it from my credit reports because of it being an inaccurate amount. Both the representative and the Supervisor stated no because a complaint from my representative was made against the company by a Mr. XXXX. I was informed if this is not pain they will report it each month on my credit as a new debt and begin legal action. I understand it is the collection company ''s right to collect what is owed but it appears as if I am being punished due to a complaint lobbied against them in reference to me by my realtor.

He kept yelling and talking over me so I asked for a supervisor. XXXX XXXX came on the line and was still rude to me.

I asked for the address and other info needed and when she told me my account number I asked if it was alphaneumeric because I couldnt tell if she was saying H or 8 and she was, you guessed it, rude. I asked my husband if he heard H and he agreed it sounded like H then I asked for the amount owed and she was rude again telling me that the amount today is less than the amount tomorrow.

I am unclear what the claimed amount owed is. Per the credit report it says balance {$4200.00} and highest balance {$2700.00}, which makes no sense to me. It also says that it was opened in XX/XX/XXXX. However, I usually check my credit at least once a month and receive regular email notifications of changes to my score and last week was the first time this appeared on my credit report. Again, between last XXXX and now, I had no communications from ATG regarding a debt owed.

They had XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) as the original creditor. 

I do not owe this alleged debt. They and XXXX had never tried to collect this from me nor notified me about this debt. 

In XX/XX/2018, I disputed the debt with Hunter Warfield, through certified mail with return delivery ( usps.com tracking # XXXX ), asking them to validate the debt because I do not owe this alleged debt. Returned cert, received showed that Hunter Warfield received my validation disputed mail on XX/XX/2018 at XXXX XXXX. But Hunter Warfield never responded and never validated the debt as required but kept reporting the debt in all 3 credit reporting agencies.

According to Fair Credit reporting Act ( FCRA & also FDCPA ), debt must be validated with 30 days after they receive my notice to validate. According to these Federal Credit Laws not validating the debt is an indication they are admitting what they are reporting is not true, false and/or fraudulous. The debt was then un-validatable and reported in error. The debt report was inaccurate and in error.

These Federal Credit Laws Stated that they must remove and delete inaccurate, false and error report from my credit record immediately. 

According to FCRA and FDCPA my credit record must be free from error and reported accurately and complete. 

Actually I did not even owe XXXX. They still had {$420.00} of my money to date. 

I want Hunter Warfield and XXXX to delete this un-validated alleged debt and inaccurate and false information from my credit record with all Credit Reporting Agencies immediately in accordance to the Federal Credit Laws, ACRA and FDCPA. And notify me when these inaccurate, false and error information are remove and deleted from my credit record. It has passed the required 30 day. It has even passed 150 days with no validation of the debt.');

The phone calls continued daily. After a length conversation ( taped ) in which a female supervisor advised they couldn''t always see the numbers they were calling in their system, I was again informed that I would absolutely not be called again. After that call I documented calls from ERC on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX ( 2x ), XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. There were more but these are documented. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I again spoke with the company. I have advised on all three conversations that a XXXX person uses this phone line as his life line and that these calls were a nusiance and causing stress and harm to this individaul. I have since been contacted by their complaince officer assurning me that i will not be called again. He also claims this is a " call forwarding '''' issue which is nonsense because the person they told me they were trying to collect from ( 2x ) had this number over thirteen years ago. I know this to be fact from the ten other companies that called in the first year I had the number. This leads me to believe that ERC participates in collecting past statute debt.');

I am asking for this verification because my credit score is important to me, and I believe it is being unjustly degraded as a result of this unfortunate error. It needs to be 100 % accurate according to the fair credit reporting act and they have not provided such documentation of verifying.

XXXX EST, a call was made to IQ Data in an effort to obtain a settlement. The representative was so rude and condescending. She even went so far as to tell me that the client informed them that they are in the process of purchasing a home and since they know they have to pay this debt, they are refusing any settlement. She even threatened not to offer settlements and threaten not to delete the debt upon settlement. That is not the scary part. The most unnerving part of this ordeal was when I asked to speak with a manager, I was denied. The representative pretended to transfer me to a manager, kept me on hold, then disconnected the call. I called back, trying to speak with a manager and was denied and transferred back to the same representative. This time the conversation started off smooth. I was no longer trying to negotiate a settlement. I wanted to get a statement of the account to provide to an Escrow agent to see if they would approve paying for this debt for the client. Again, I was denied. I was threatened to be hung up on multiple times. I begged and pleaded to speak with someone else anyone else. The next agent came on the line and started off polite.

At this point, I was confused because they just took a payment of {$370.00} so I called back to inquire about the difference of what they took and what the email said. I spoke to the manager, XXXX, who stated they would refund the difference but we would have to wait for it to clear first because it was not showing posted to the account as of yet. I proceeded to wait a couple days and I called back and spoke with the same gentlemen who at this time advised they would not refund my money and that I would have to contact my bank directly to stop the payment and then we could redo the transaction even though they knew at this time the bank would not be putting a stop on the payment. I called my bank and they processed it as a dispute, but after their investigation determined the payment was valid and would not refund my money. I feel that RPM misrepresented an offer to settle my debt and fraudulently took a higher amount because it benefited their employee and meant more money for his own paycheck. This is clearly false representation and I feel that the company is stealing my money when they were fully aware there was a lower offer on the account. Additionally, when I received conflicting information and contacted them about it, they again misrepresented an opportunity for me to get a refund of the overpayment, which I have not received as of yet.');

I called a week ago to settle an old debt and was immediately met with abusive language and tactics. I offered them several amounts to settle this debt and not one was agreed upon. For some reason they feel the need to be unreasonable and rude. I find this very odd since I was attempting to settle a debt on my own accord. I do realize they work on commission however. 

Since we could not come to an agreement on a settlement amount, the call was terminated. 

I called back several days later and attempted again to settle this debt and was met with even worse tactics and suggestive language. All of were very low class. I upped my offer amount to close to the full amount that was originally owed and still they would not accept. So once again the call was terminated. 

Today they called my work screaming at me and demanding payment in full or else they would report that I was absconding from my debt to the authorities. 

I called several hours later to report this abusive behavior. I was escalated to a manager at IQ Data International. I repeated to them again that they were to have no contact with me accept through mail and not to call me in any way shape or form. Of course they had no record of the call and demanded my work number. I told them I was not comfortable giving them the work number and she started yelling at me that she couldn''t help me then!

You could hear the boiler room in the background and everyone was yelling and clapping with all the debt they had collected that day. You could hear {$21000.00}!!!!! Good Job!

Needles to say she hung up and there was no resolution to my complaint. This is kind of a Fox watching the Hen house situation.');

During this phone call, I mentioned that I do not remember ever receiving a bill from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. because all my bills were being directed to my Lawyer. I explained that I was in a car accident where a vehicle hit me when I was stopped at a red light and the Lawyer was handling all the calls and the bills. 

At this point, XXXX XXXX from Choice recovery told me that he was no longer aloud to discuss this account with me by law and asked for my Lawyers number, so he could contact directly. I gave him my Lawyers contact information. 

Yesterday, on XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed that my credit score dropped 24 points!!! When I looked to see why it dropped, it stated that 7 new accounts were opened and the total number of derogatory accounts had also increase by 7. Looking into it further, I found that all 7 new accounts and 7 derogatory accounts were from Choice Recovery INC. 

Today XX/XX/XXXX, at XXXX XXXX I called XXXX XXXX at Choice and asked why they were attacking my credit. I was told y XXXX XXXX that they were unable to get in touch with my lawyer and by law they are not allowed to contact me without my Lawyer ''s permission and can not discuss any other details about my case. I then asked to speak to his Manager. 

XXXX XXXX transferred a call to XXXX XXXX and she proceeded to repeat the same information that XXXX XXXX presented me with. I told her that I completely understand that they are by law not allowed to contact me with out my Lawyers permission, but if you couldn''t get a hold of them, you could have at least informed of this information so I could call my Lawyer and have them directly reach out to you instead of just attacking my credit. ( They didn''t get permission to contact me from my Lawyer but didn''t get permission to attack my credit history either but they did!! ) I asked how a could get this removed from my credit history and she told me that I needed to contact my lawyer and have them contact Choice Recovery INC for something to be worked out before they could see if something could be done with my credit. 

They attacked my credit without my knowledge, without giving me a chance to resolve the issue, then hold my credit score hostage with no guarantee to fix my credit. How is this allowed? If they are not allowed to contact me by law and they don''t get a hold of my Lawyer, I''m left in the dark till one day I get a surprise of a 24 point hit to my credit score!!');

Then I received the other attached document threatening me to pay {$2000.00} by XX/XX/2018. 
I paid XX/XX/2018 mortgage {$1100.00} I paid XX/XX/2018 mortgage {$1100.00} I paid XX/XX/2018 mortgage {$1100.00} ( XX/XX/2018 ) I then paid {$2000.00} ( under the reservation of rights law - XX/XX/2018 ) I paid XX/XX/2018 mortgage {$1100.00} So what month is the {$2000.00} for? Not to mention the amount is well above the amount of my mortgage! My bank statements stand proof of this and have been sent to Seterus , Inc . They will NOT answer the question! They blame my lawyer who discharged the bankruptcy, but NO motion of cure was needed since it discharged as all months were proved paid! 
So again, WHAT month is Delinquent? I want the month in XX/XX/2018 that was delinquent as per their letter reads when they threatened to accelerate the loan!

I told her if I can not receive a receipt or documentation on the plan yes please cancel. She then told me that my balance for BOTH of my accounts are now due in full. This is not fair as the account that had the plan has nothing to do with the other account as they are two separate accounts. This is an unfair attempt for retaliation and I think they need to be investigated for their policy and tactics as a financial collection service. I had not problem paying them back until I was told that I would not receipt the appropriate documentation until I give them all of the money. The rep then asked me if I have received any of their attempts to collect ( which she knows I did not because I changed my address in the system with her when I made the initial payment ) she then told me she can send a bill for the balance of both of the accounts to my address on file. You mean to tell me you can not send me a receipt or proof of payment but you can send me a bill and request for payment of debt?');

This case was closed today, but the information required by law was not provided in the answer from the company. I received the original instrument, according to state law ALLY financial has to provided deficiency notices in order to report a repo on my credit report. This was not received per FCRA this has to be removed because 30 days has passed and the company has not provided the legal requirement to have the right to report this on my credit history. There have been several miss-applied payments to the account in question. Each time a call was made to ALLY financial when each misapplied payment was made. 

IN addition to this, I have disputed the information on my credit file and ALLY financial should have notice of this information as well. 

The request to provide a notarized copy of the deficiency notices mailed to the address on file has not been satisfied. Legally this would be considered fraud. I will open up a case with the FTC and file a ID theft notice and seek legal action against ALLY financial for violation of FTC up to {$1000.00} per occurrence.

I believe the company is providing misleading information and does not have consumer ''s best interest in mind. 

I have been paying off my student loans for the past 2 years. I have never missed a payment and decided I wanted to be slightly more aggressive with paying off my loans. For this reason, on XX/XX/2019, I made and additional {$500.00} payment outside of my scheduled monthly payments. My goal was to pay off my loan with the highest interest rate. 

Great Lakes does have an option to specify which loan your extra payment will be applied. However, they also have statement on their webpage saying " Once your scheduled monthly payment and all outstanding interest has been paid, we automatically apply any excess payment amounts to the loan with the highest interest rate, thus costing you less interest over time. '''' This statement is telling you what will happen if you do not select a specific loan for the excess payment to be applied. 

A few days later, I logged-on to my online portal to ensure the {$500.00} was applied to my loan with the highest interest rate only to find that the excess payment had been distributed across all of my loans. I have 4 loans serviced by Great Lakes with amounts varying from {$2000.00} to over {$30000.00} ( perks of XXXX XXXX ) with interest rates varying from 3.15 % to 6.55 %. 

I called to inquire. I thought it might have to do with the timing of the extra payment in relation to the monthly scheduled payment. 

The customer representative who spoke with me informed me that 1 ) excess payments are not automatically applied to the loan with the highest interest rate but rather my excess payment had been distributed in my " best interest '''' with a high percentage going towards loans with higher balances and 2 ) I needed to specify if I wanted the excess payment applied to a certain loan. 

The information shared over the phone and what is happening in practice goes directly against information provided on the website. More alarming was the pressure from the service representative to pay-off higher balance loans rather than higher interest rate loans.');

How is this possible? Under the laws of the FCRA, I have contacted the collection agency myself through Certified Return Request Mail XX/XX/2018 and also through a recent CFPB claim and have been unable to get them to verify that this is my debt. I did not ask for a verification of my address or who the creditor is etc., I asked for a copy of the signed contract with my name on it and what exactly I was being billed for. I received neither. Nothing. The CFPB claim on XXXX XXXX XXXX asks XXXX  to validate these debts, and validate the services rendered that I allegedly received. I was given no evidence of my obligation to pay this debt to this collection agency. In fact they ignored my prior requests until I filed the claim with the CFPB and immediately after they claimed to have forwarded to me verification in XXXX but they werent sure of the date. If this letter was sent it was NOT received at my address and XXXX holds no proof of sending this letter nor proof of it being delivered to my address. This trickery is violating my rights under the FCRA. It is clear that XXXX XXXX XXXX can not legitimately validate this alleged debt as mine. It is now the Credit Bureaus legal responsibility to immediately remove this from my credit report. The FCRA requires you to verify the validity of the item within 30 days. I have sent two letters to your company, which means you have had 60 days to validate this debt and have you not followed through with my requests in accordance with the FCRA. If the validity can not be properly verified, you are obligated by law to remove the item immediately. There is a very clear case of unverified debt here, and I urge you to remove this item quickly before I am forced to take legal action to protect my consumer rights. In the event that you can not immediately verify the item pursuant to the FCRA, and you continue to list the disputed item on my credit report I will find it necessary to sue you for actual damages and declaratory relief under the FCRA. According to this regulation, I may sue you in any qualified state or federal court, including small claims court in my area. While I prefer not to litigate, I will use the courts as needed to enforce my rights under the FCRA. I look forward to an uneventful resolution of this matter.');

XXXX stated that once it has been turned over to a debt collector, they can''t do anything and that I would have to call XXXX and have them send the debt back. 

I reached out to XXXX again on XX/XX/XXXX and advised them again that the account was never submitted to insurance. The agent then told me that if it wasn''t sent through insurance then the full amount becomes patient responsibility, which is incorrect and illegal. I advised him that it is illegal to not file with insurance if someone pays for and carries insurance. He again stated that it is patient responsibility and that is why he offered a 30 % discount. I advised him that even with the 30 % discount it would more than likely be more than what I would pay if they had filed through insurance. I asked him if I could give him my insurance information so it could be sent back and he stated that there was nothing he could do and he can''t send it back. I advised him that I would not be paying at this time, because it was not submitted through insurance and once it''s submitted then I will pay it. He said he would notate the account and that was the end of the conversation.

I did so in XX/XX/XXXX. They made no mention of any alternate options I may have had to settle the obligation and made an agreement with me. They agreed to remove the debt from my credit reports in exchange for regular payments automatically deducted from my checking account. I made those payments every month as accepted. 

Late last year, I switched banks. As is common these days, I had 15+ billers with access to my bank account, including utilities, credit cards, store cards, etc. I did not remember all of them. All of the companies understood and these billing clerical errors were immediately resolved. MCA Management Company and XXXX XXXX did not. XXXX XXXX, of MCA Management Company and/or her company immediately fired off 4+ separate credit bureau negatives, but now under the original creditor ''s name, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, rather than what used to be their own. even though it was previously combined as one. Upon contacting her in multiple attempts, in good faith, offering to catch up on the two payments immediately, and courteously explaining the situation, this person, XXXX XXXX was unreasonable, offered zero empathy, and seemed to revel in her ability to affect my credit shortly before my family attempting to buy the home we have resided in for 12 years. XXXX XXXX may have committed blatant malfeasance and caused my distress, psychological, financial damages. 

As though none of this happened, she or her staff has resumed calling me. MCA Management company is notorious for this behavior is predatory in their practices. They put personal gain, and seemingly sadistic satisfaction ahead of any interests of the region and community they operate in. 

Also attempt to mislead consumers by using a DBA, tied to the same acronym of MCA. They refer to themselves sometimes as MCA Management Company, and other times as Medical Commercial Audit Company Inc. Even a third time as simply MCA Management. In reality the only valid name I can find is actually, " MCA MAnagement Company/Medical-Commercial Audit Inc. '''' This is inconsistent and demonstrates a lack of transparency. Furthermore, they do not provide a physical address anywhere. They are using a PO Box as their business address. They have actually registered their business as a Post Office Box, which from my understanding is not permitted. There is a " workaround '''' to do this, but I''m not sure this is legitimate. 

For whatever reason, the owner, XXXX XXXX XXXX, in addition to operating under multiple expired names, and a P.O. Box listed as the required physical address, has remained out of site in this entire process. All told, I''m having trouble seeing how this company isn''t operating under, and attempting to collect debts in an erroneous, misleading, and potentially illegal manner. 

They also seem to be using these Fictitious Names, all expired : M C A MANAGEMENT CO.

The Ac cost {$2400.00}, the death of horse, {$1000.00}. Together they pushed my finances over my limits. I began by borrowing what use to be called a " payday '''' loan, but is now called a " flex Loan ''''. This got to be so expensive that I ( quite foolishly ) took out another to pay the first. This became EIGHT/8 " loans '''' from " XXXX ", " XXXX XXXX XXXX '''' type high-interest lenders. In XXXX I finally decided to address the issues with each one. Up until that point I had not missed any payments! I CLOSED the bank account that I had been using to pay them by auto debit. A new card was issued, also. So I began contacting ALL lenders to make payment arrangements that would " make everyone happy '''' and to let them know I was NOT TRYING TO SKIP MY BILL, just pay smaller amount for longer period and HOPE they might lower interest rates! 
The first lender ( XXXX  ) stated I owed {$780.00} and they would drop it to {$350.00} if I paid in 2 payments, which I did! However, the first and biggest interest lender, XXXX, was the second lender I called. It has NOT turned out well! 
XXXX HAS STOLED XXXX from my " new '''' bank account!!! I DID NOT authorize this payment!! On XX/XX/XXXX, I called them and asked for help/consideration in giving me more time and smaller payments! I stated I could only pay them {$200.00} per month, and was willing to give them the {$200.00}. payment at that moment, by phone. This was on the NEW debit card that WAS NOT part of any agreement I had with them! They took the {$200.00} that night, XX/XX/XXXX. 
However, on the second of XXXX a huge almost {$400.00} amount was deducted from my new bank account by XXXX!!! I immediately called my bank and went to see local manager to REVERSE this as unauthorized! Bank manager stated that since I gave/authorized them the {$200.00} in XXXX, they were allowed to take this $ XXXX+ out in XX/XX/XXXX!!! 
How can I dispute my own bank. I will NOT be staying with them if that is their logic! If that were the case any and every payment I ever made to ANYONE, could use my debit info and STEAL whatever they wanted from my bank account!!! This is asinine! 
I want the bank to recover my funds ASAP. 
I have since called more lenders and all have been amenable to other arrangements that work out for everyone, included a 60 day window, no fees, and weekly payments instead of monthly! When I asked XXXX if they would TAKE unauthorized $ from my bank other than what we agreed on she ( XXXX ) stated that unauthorized payments were illegal and they would not do that and that I should call police and my bank and file charges To me it is stealing! I an trying very hard to do they right thing. Therefore, all other entities should also be required to. Including my own bank, XXXX XXXX XXXX out of XXXX, Tn. 
There should be laws preventing this theft of funds by any entity! Just because I approve ONE payment does not mean any payment they feel like taking! If that was the case, XXXX would be dipping into my bank account, and the electric company, and anyone I " do business with ''''! 

Please help. Thank you for your attention to this serious matter, XXXX XXXX');

The first did not arrive, the second arrived however it was burnt from our house fire. A third was send on the date extension XX/XX/18, with the due date XX/XX/18. The bill arrived afterwards, however an extension was not given. 
We attempted to pay at a local Wells Fargo to no avail. Email was unavailable to pay the bill. There is now a charge-off negative remark on my credit report.
